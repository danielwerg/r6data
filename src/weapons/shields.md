# Ballistic Shield

The standard variant of the ballistic shield is currently available to only one operator, which is Fuze. Special variants are available for Blitz and Montagne. Clash also has a special shield, but it functions a bit differently than every other shield in the game.

# General Details

A Ballistic Shield is carried as Primary Weapon. It is carried with the left hand, while the operator's right hand carries their secondary weapon, which can be used. A shield constantly protects the operator from incoming gunfire from the direction the shield is facing.

A shield is tall enough to protect the operator's head and body. The legs are exposed while standing, but the window of vulnerability can be reduced by crouching. THe user's shoulders are also exposed. A shield can also be aimed upward or downward to protect different angles.

There is a panel of bulletproof glass at the operator's eye level for sight. However, this glass can be damaged and cracked, reducing visibility.

While carrying a Ballistic Shield, an operator can walk, crouch-walk, or sprint. The user can also can also unequip the shield, in which the secondary weapon will be fully equipped. Going prone will unequip the shield, and shields cannot be used while rappelling (at all times).

The shield is present at all times. While not equipped, a shield is stored at the user's back, protecting the back of the user's body, but not the head.

Regular-sized shields do not protect the legs while standing or sprinting, leaving them vulnerable. In addition, the sides and rear of the user are open at all times while the shield is equipped, making the user vulnerable to ambushes or explosives tossed over their shield.

## Using Secondary Weapon

A shield user keeps their right arm and hand behind the shield. This renders them unable to fire from the hip.

Instead of hip fire, pressing and holding the FIRE button will instead cause the shield user to FREE LOOK, turning their head around for sight of different angles, while keeping the shield facing front. However, if the button is released, the user's body and the shield will face the direction of last focus at time of release.

While carrying the shield, The operator can press AIM to use their secondary weapon. When aiming down sights, the user holds the shield horizontally, exposing their head. The sidearm can only fire once the aim animation is fully complete.

## Utilities

Several actions are performed behind the shield's protection.

An operator performs a RELOAD behind the protection of their shield. They can also reload while carrying only the secondary weapon, but this does not equip the shield to give temporary protection.

Shields can perform a MELEE attack by pushing the shield directly forward, dealing 65 damage and still covering the body and head. A shield's melee attack pushes the hit enemy away and knocks them onto their back, similar to that of an Oryx's Remah Dash or Nomad's Airjab. If an enemy is pushed into a breakable wall or hatch, it is breached and the victim receives an additional 5 damage. Meleeing directly at a breakable wall will only cause a peek hole, similar to any gun meleeing a wall.

With a shield equipped, the user can instantly BREAK THROUGH Barricades, destroying them instantly regardless of remaining health, and making entry in the process. They can also still melee the barricade 3 times to break it.

A user can throw grenades (such as Frag Grenades, Smoke Grenades) and trigger gadgets (Breach Charges and Fuze's Cluster Charge) behind the shield.

Operator placed gadgets, such as Fuze's Cluster Charge, a Breach Charge or a Hard Breach Charge, can be equipped and deployed, but the user's shield will be temporarily unequipped while they are deploying either of these charges.

## Weaknesses and Countermeasures

By default, when an operator has a shield in their possession, their Speed is reduced by 10% of their base speed (20% for Blitz), regardless of the shield is equipped or not.

Explosive damage, such as Nitro Cells and Impact Grenades, is reduced but not negated when taken from the front. They can also be thrown behind the shield to bypass the protection.

Meleeing a shield will cause the shield to be knocked aside to their left as the user flinches, exposing their body to an attack. The distance and angle the shield moves when hit is different for each shield. The small ballistic shields, including Montagne's undeployed shield, move nearly 90 degrees to the operator's left, where-as Clash's deployed CCE shield moves about 20-30 degrees, and Montagne's deployed shield only moves about 10-15 degrees. It is important to note that none of the shields move if they are unequipped on the operator's back, or if they are in the middle of another animation.

If the shield is impacted sufficiently by gunfire, the user enters a SUPPRESSED FIRE status, which renders them unable to sprint for that duration, even if the shield is unequipped. The amount of gunfire required to cause the SUPPRESSED FIRE status is dependent on the offending weapon's caliber. Weapons such as shotguns or marksman rifles have high impact, and will cause the suppression faster and make it last longer.
