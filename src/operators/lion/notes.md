# Lion

## Gameplay Description

Lion comes with his EE-ONE-D, which flies up above the map to scan for enemy movement at his command. If a Defender moves during this scan, the drone will detect that movement and ping them repeatedly for Attackers to see, even through walls.

- Lion's presence causes his EE-ONE-D drone to appear in the airspace around the map. It cannot be destroyed.
- Lion can activate his EE-ONE-D's sonar ability 3 times per round.
- The EE-ONE-D drone gives a 1.5 second warning to both Attackers and Defenders before it starts scanning.
- The scanning process comes after the warning phase, and lasts 2 seconds. Any Defender who moves during this phase will be marked with several red pings, visible by all Attackers, even through walls and through drones/cameras. Ceasing movement does not stop the pinging.
  - The Drone will only detect the movements of Defenders who move from their position during the scan. Turning, changing stances, or using any gadget or weapon will not cause the Defender to be spotted.
    - However, vertical movement, such as breaking a hatch and falling through it, does get scanned by the Drone.
- The EE-ONE-D has a cooldown of 15 seconds between activations.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Lion works well with other Operators who are suited to either clearing out a room and/or discourage roaming Defenders, one way or another.
- Fuze's Cluster Charges can force Defenders to flee from the room he is clearing, thus allow Lion to track them. Alternatively, Lion's pings can show Fuze where the Defenders are, allowing him to place his Cluster Charges more precisely.
- Jackal is a great partner in intimidating roamers, as the Eyenox gives Defenders the incentive to move around so that their current location won't be tracked, while Lion forces them to stay still in order to not be tracked.
- Using Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb immediately after the EE-ONE-D scan may stop Defenders from moving for a few seconds. However, it is not recommended to use these gadgets at the same time. If used in tandem, the Logic Bomb after the EE-ONE-D scan, it will force Defenders to stay still for several seconds.
- Exothermic Operators, such as Thermite and Hibana can work well with Lion as the timing of their explosives can work well for the latter's benefit, forcing Defenders to choose whether to prevent a surface from being exposed or maintain their cover from the EE-ONE-D.
- Lion also works well with anti-electronic Operators, such as Thatcher and Twitch, as they can destroy Signal Disruptors that would otherwise interfere with the EE-ONE-D's function.

### Counters

- Being within range of one of Mute's Signal Disruptors will disrupt the EE-ONE-D's scan for anyone within their area of effect.
  - If Lion is within the range of a Signal Disruptor, he will also be unable to activate his drone at all.
