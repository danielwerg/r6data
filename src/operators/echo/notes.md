# Echo

## Gameplay Description

Echo's unique gadgets are two hovering drones called Yokai, which can stick to flat surfaces on a ceiling, as well as emit ultrasonic bursts that can disorient the enemy.

### Yokai

- Echo spawns carrying two Yokai drones. Echo deploys a Yokai drone by throwing it out.
  - The Yokai have two modes of operation: a ground mode where it can move and cannot fire ultrasonic bursts, and a ceiling mode where it cannot move and can fire ultrasonic bursts.
  - The Yokai starts in the ground level mode when deployed.
  - After a Yokai is deployed, their camera feeds are added to the Defenders' camera pool, inside a separate list to the default Security Cameras.
  - Echo and his teammates can scan and tag enemies with the Yokai drones.
  - All Defenders can use Yokai's cameras, but only Echo can use ultrasonic burst on Yokai drones.
  - The Yokai drone is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
    - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
      - IQ can also detect Echo's PDA whenever Echo is using the PDA.
    - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds or Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds; the Yokai will drop to the ground if it was attached to the ceiling when it was hit by the EMP. Vision on the drone will be disrupted and movement will be impaired.
    - Destroyed by Twitch's Shock Drones.
    - Hacked by Brava's Kludge Drones.
      - When hacked Yokai drones are recaptured by Mozzie's Pest or Mozzie operated Kludge Drones, Echo will regain control of the drone.
- On the ground, Echo can move the Yokai drone horizontally in all four directions, but cannot use its ultrasonic bursts.
  - The Yokai drones are small enough to be able to fit through drone holes.
  - On the ground, the Yokai have the ability to launch itself vertically upwards. During the upward ascent, if the Yokai comes into contact with a flat ceiling (and certain slanted surfaces), it will attach and secure itself, and enter the ceiling mode.
    - The Yokai's horizontal movements are temporarily disabled during the vertical launch.
    - The Yokai have a 2 second cooldown between jumps.
    - The Yokai's jump is limited vertically to 10 meters.
    - If the Yokai does hit a surface it cannot latch to, it will shake for 0.5s before falling back down.
  - On the ground, the camera on the Yokai drones can pan up to 40 degrees upwards, but not downwards.
- On the ceiling, the Yokai drone becomes immobile and can fire its ultrasonic bursts.
  - On the ceiling, the Yokai's cameras cannot pan up, but can freely pan downwards.
  - Echo can manually make the Yokai detach from the ceiling and return to ground mode operation.
- The Yokai will lose signal and deactivate if they move outside the building for more than 10 seconds.
  - The effects of losing signal are similar to the effects of Mute's Signal Disruptor on Attacker drones, with visual disruption before complete signal loss.
  - The line "LOSING SIGNAL, GET BACK INSIDE" will appear on the HUD when losing signal.
  - Echo can go outside, pick up a Yokai that lost signal, and redeploy it inside to reactivate it.

### Ultrasonic Burst

- When the Yokai is on the ceiling, Echo can aim and fire Yokai's ultrasonic burst with the Yokai's camera view.
  - The Yokai has up to two ultrasonic charges in reserve.
  - After firing an ultrasonic burst, the Yokai recharges one charge every 15 seconds.
  - Firing an ultrasonic burst fires a small sphere-like projectile from the Yokai towards the aimed direction; when any Operator (Attacker or Defender) is hit by the burst (on any part of their body), they will be disorientated.The blast has a small area of effect and can disorient multiple foes. The blast can travel through holes big enough, such as melee holes but not bullet holes.
  - The blasts' effective range is 15 meters.
  - Although ultrasonic blasts appear to have travel time, they actually travel instantaneously.
- When a character is hit by an ultrasonic blast, they will receive the following effects:
  - Most continuous actions that the target is performing will be cancelled.
    - The only action that the burst cannot cancel is pulling the needle from Lesion's Gu mines.
  - The effects of Finka's Adrenal Surge are overridden.
  - Temporary blindness.
  - Slight screen shake.
  - Hearing disrupted.
  - Visual disorientation effects will be applied; the player's vision is blurred, the player will see shaking double vision, the peripheral vision is blacked out, and the player can see scattered dots of light.
    - The disorientation effects lasts 10 seconds.
    - Moving will worsen the disorientation effects, resulting in more peripheral vision being blacked out and causing a strong screen sway.
- The disorientation effects are overridden when:
  - Finka's Adrenal Surge is activated (for Attackers)
  - The Operator is afflicted with the concussion effects of Zofia's concussion grenades or Ela's Grzmot Mines.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Tall flat surfaces (shelves and closets) provide good cover for Yokai. Echo can throw Yokai up to the spot, attach it to the ceiling, and hide Yokai drones by dropping back onto the shelf after using a blast.
- The ultrasonic blasts are extremely useful in denying many key attacker actions:
  - Thermite's deployment of an Exothermic Charge can be canceled, delaying a breach.
  - Operators setting down a Breach Charge.
  - Fuze's deployment of his Cluster Charge.
  - Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb call.
  - Iana's Gemini Replicator during use, only if Iana herself is hit.
  - Flores' deployment of his RCE-RATERO drone.
  - An Attacker's plant of a defuser in Bomb can be denied, delaying a key game objective.
  - Montagne with his shield extended will be forced to retract his shield when hit by the burst.

### Counters

- Thatcher's EMP Grenades will disable the Yokai for 15 seconds or Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds and will force Yokai drones to detach from the ceiling and render them virtually useless.
- IQ and her Electronics Scanner can quickly identify the Yokai's location, as well as Echo himself while he's on his PDA, making her the most dangerous detriment to their survival.
- Zero's ARGUS Camera and Twitch's Shock Drone lasers can destroy Yokai drones.
- The latter applies to Kali's LV Lances and Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones.
- Using explosive devices can be useful for destroying Yokai if an approximate location is known, as falling down and moving away takes a considerable amount of time for the Yokai.
- Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb can hack into a Yokai drone as with any other surveillance device. It can also force Echo off his PDA for a short amount of time as Echo must reset his PDA.
- NÃ¸kk's HEL will remove her image from Echo's drones. Echo's drone will show that she is nearby, however.
- Finka's Adrenal Surge cleanses the disorientation effect from Echo's Yokai drone.
