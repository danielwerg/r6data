# Ace

## Gameplay Description

Ace's Unique Gadget is the SELMA Breaching Device. When thrown onto a breachable surface, the SELMA will extend a set of explosive arms, then detonate, creating a wide opening which can be used to establish line of sight. If there is room on the surface, the SELMA will lower down and detonate one more time, creating a larger opening through which Attackers can enter.

- The SELMA can also destroy hatches on the floor, but it cannot activate sequential explosions when used on a floor.
  - Two SELMA breaches are required to destroy a reinforced hatch.
- The SELMA will only activate when thrown onto a breachable surface. Ace can pick up any SELMA which hasn't activated.
- Each SELMA will detonate twice, the second time lowering and detonating again. This creates a larger hole that can only be vaulted or crouch-walked through.
  - It takes 4 seconds for first detonation and another 4 for second.
- The SELMAs use a similar throwing profile to Impact Grenades, and can be thrown further.
- Mira's Black Mirrors can be destroyed by the SELMA if within its explosion range.
  - This will occur even if the slightest bit of the SELMA is touching the Black Mirror.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The SELMA's extendable arms can destroy any Defender gadget in the vicinity as they expand, meaning Ace can use one to lower defenses from a distance.
- Gadgets such as Thatcher's EMP Grenades, Twitch's Shock Drone, Kali's LV Lances, Zero's Argus Cameras, Flores' RCE-RATERO drone, can assist Ace by taking out Defender gadgets which prevent SELMAs from operating.

### Counters

- SELMAs can be destroyed by anyone who shoots the gadget, even if has already started its detonation sequence.
- SELMAs will not work on walls electrified by Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.
- Thrown SELMAs can be intercepted by JÃ¤ger's ADS or Wamai's Mag-Net.
- Mute's Signal Jammers can also stop SELMAs from activating. If the Jammer is destroyed, the SELMA will immediately activate again.
- The SELMAs explosion does little damage to Defenders, meaning they can risk getting close and attack while the breach is ongoing.
- The SELMAs can be destroyed by Impact Grenades and a well thrown Nitro Cell once one patch of a SELMA breach is open.
- Maestro's Evil Eye can destroy Ace's SELMAs with its laser.
