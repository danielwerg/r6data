# Rook

## Gameplay Description

Rook comes with a bag of five R1N "Rhino" Armor Plates. These Armor Plates can be picked up and equipped for added damage resistance.

- Rook's Armor Plates come in a satchel which he can place down. In it, there will be five Armor Plates ready to be picked up.
  - Each Armor Plate takes 3 seconds to equip.
- Unlike other gadgets, Rook cannot pick up the satchel once dropped.
- Attackers can also pick up Armor Plates, though they will not have a HUD icon signifying its location and contents.
- The satchel can be destroyed by any source of damage after being placed.
  - The satchel is sturdier than other gadgets. Aside from explosives or melee, destroying it takes more than a couple of hits.
- When setting down the satchel, Rook will automatically pickup an Armor Plate and attach it to himself.
  - This action takes roughly 5 seconds.
  - Canceling at 50% will prevent rook from taking armor but will still deploy satchel.
- Armor Plates grant withstand.
- When an Armor Plate is worn, Operator's health capacity increased by 20.
  - Despite the armor being only applied to the chest during the animation; the armor affects all parts of the body (except the head).
  - Explosives will deal less damage when an Armor Plate is applied to an Operator.
- Armor Plates guarantee that the Operator wearing it is downed instead of killed when their health depletes. However, headshots are still instantly lethal.
  - Being downed while wearing the Armor Plate sets bleedout timer to 60 seconds regardles if Operator stopping the bleed or not while if Operator not wearing Armor Plate it is only 30 seconds and 60 seconds if Operator is stopping the bleed.
  - When downed, the Operator will lose their Armor Plate. Operator can equip armor only once per round.
  - While the Armor Plate ensures that the Operator is downed, the DBNO policy of "can only be downed once per round" applies.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Rook works especially well with fellow GIGN defending Operator Doc. With his Stim Pistol at hand, he is able to heal allies, revive downed Operators from afar along with granting Operators an Overheal. These qualities shine with the Armor Plates that guarantees DBNO.
- The latter also applies to Thunderbird's KÃ³na Stations. Each station can heal, revive downed Operators manually, and helps increase the survivability of allies.

### Counters

- Even with the Plates on, Operators will instantly die from melee attacks as per usual.
  - Though not particularly practical, Sledge's Breaching Hammer will still kill an Operator with Armor Plates, as it counts as a melee strike.
- When Operator with armor is downed, a sound similar to Blackbeard's shield breaking can be heard from either team.
