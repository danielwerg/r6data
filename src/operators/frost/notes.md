# Frost

## Gameplay Description

Frost comes equipped with three Sterling MK2 LHTs, nicknamed "Welcome Mats." The Welcome Mats are mechanical traps that can be used to incapacitate enemies.

- The Welcome Mat can be placed in most places on the floor, be it under a window or on the other side of a table, or even against the wall. Some tight spaces may or may not allow the Mat to be placed.
  - Defender gadgets such as Alibi's Prismas or Lesion's Gu Mines can also prevent a Welcome Mat from being placed. However, most devices can be placed on top of a Welcome Mat.
- Each Welcome Mat takes 3 seconds to deploy.
  - Frost's hitbox is vertically smaller while deploying a Welcome Mat, as if she was crouching. This can allow a Frost to place a mat in front of a window during a round, although this is not normally advised.
- Welcome Mats will immediately put any Attacker stepping on them into a DBNO state.
  - Attacker can choose to wait for a teammate to perform the revive, if they do so, they will not receive the debuff when leaving the trap. This should grant Frost opportunities to hunt teammates willing to help trapped players while attackers are rewarded for playing as a team.
  - Trapped players will need 4 seconds to exit the trap regardless of the revive method. This should grant extra time for defenders to finish off trapped enemies before they can stand up.
  - If players remove the trap by themselves, a debuff will be applied to them. The effects are as follow:
    - Duration is 60 seconds.
    - Will move 20% slower
    - Won't be able to sprint.
    - Will leave a trail of blood behind them.
    - Health is set to 20 hp.
- An Attacker caught in the Trap can only be rescued via manual revive; Finka's Adrenal Surge, Rook's Armor Plating Self-Revive, and Doc's Stim Pistol shots all cannot revive a player downed by the Welcome Mat.
- One Welcome Mat can only be triggered once. The Welcome Mat is effectively destroyed once an Attacker is caught in the trap, regardless of if the Attacker is rescued or not.
  - Though the Welcome Mat appears intact when an Attacker is trapped in it, it cannot be destroyed in this state, and the Attacker cannot be rescued by attempting to destroy the mat itself.
  - Being caught by a Welcome Mat is considered entering the Down But Not Out state. R6 allows DBNO only once per round, this means players that have already been DBNO will immediately die if they fall into a Frost trap..
- An Attacker moving onto a Welcome Mat while downed will be instantly killed.
- The Welcome Mat is fairly durable, being able to take a number of gunshots before being destroyed.
  - For the Welcome Mat to be destroyed it needs all 100 health to be depleted.
  - Picking up a Welcome Mat will reset its "health pool".
  - Melee will destroy them in one hit, but is not an advisable approach to destroy them given the nature of this gadget.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Any Operator that has Barbed Wire can use the wire to conceal Welcome Mats and make it harder for Attacking Operators to notice.
- Frost works well with Bandit and Kaid. If an electrified set of Barbed Wire is placed on top of a Mat, any caught Attackers will die quickly.
- Smoke also works well with Frost, as Attackers can easily get caught in a well placed Welcome Mat as they attempt to push through Smoke's gas, eventually succumbing to its toxic effects while they are downed from the trap.
- Lesion is another Defender with a similar playstyle and gadget. If he is able to place his Gu Mine the right distance away from the trap, an incoming Attacker will get caught in the trap, with their leg triggering the Gu Mine, leading to a quick death.
  - However, if the Gu Mine is activated first, the Welcome Mat will then down the Attacker and cancel out the poison effects.
- As Frost's Welcome Mat places enemies in a downed state, Caveira will be able to interrogate them.
- Oryx can perform his dash on an unsuspecting enemy; if they land on a mat, it would instantly down them, allowing for him to quickly kill them.
- Thorn's Razorbloom Shells can be placed near the welcome mat, the timer will kill them without manual trigger.

### Counters

- Explosives can very easily destroy a Welcome Mat that's within their blast radius, but that depends on if all 100 health is depleted
- If swinging in from a window or vaulting over a Deployable Shield, an Attacker can quickly shoot a Welcome Mat with enough bullets to destroy it, preventing themselves from being trapped.
- Flores' RCE-Ratero can destroy Welcome Mats.
