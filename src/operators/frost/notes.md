# Frost

## Gameplay Description

Frost comes equipped with three Sterling MK2 LHTs, nicknamed "Welcome Mats." The Welcome Mats are mechanical traps that can be used to incapacitate enemies.

- The Welcome Mat can be placed in most places on the floor, be it under a window or on the other side of a table, or even against the wall. Some tight spaces may or may not allow the Mat to be placed.
  - Defender gadgets such as Alibi's Prismas or Lesion's Gu Mines can also prevent a Welcome Mat from being placed. However, most devices can be placed on top of a Welcome Mat.
- Each Welcome Mat takes 3 seconds to deploy.
  - Frost's hitbox is vertically smaller while deploying a Welcome Mat, as if she was crouching. This can allow a Frost to place a mat in front of a window during a round, although this is not normally advised.
- Welcome Mats will immediately put any Attacker stepping on them into a DBNO state.
  - A trapped attacker cannot move or slow down the bleed rate. Attempting to move will only cause the Attacker to thrash around and create noise.
  - An Attacker caught in the Trap can only be rescued via manual revive; Finka's Adrenal Surge, Rook's Armor Plating Self-Revive, and Doc's Stim Pistol shots all cannot revive a player downed by the Welcome Mat.
  - One Welcome Mat can only be triggered once. The Welcome Mat is effectively destroyed once an Attacker is caught in the trap, regardless of if the Attacker is rescued or not.
    - Though the Welcome Mat appears intact when an Attacker is trapped in it, it cannot be destroyed in this state, and the Attacker cannot be rescued by attempting to destroy the mat itself.
  - The Welcome Mat can only put an Attacker in a DBNO state, even if that Operator has already been downed before. For example, if an Attacker happens to come across all three Welcome Mats in one game, they will be downed every single time.
  - An Attacker moving onto a Welcome Mat while downed will be instantly killed.
- The Welcome Mat is fairly durable, being able to take a number of gunshots before being destroyed.
  - For the Welcome Mat to be destroyed it needs all 100 health to be depleted.
  - Picking up a Welcome Mat will reset its "health pool".
  - Melee will destroy them in one hit, but is not an advisable approach to destroy them given the nature of this gadget.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Any Operator that has Barbed Wire can use the wire to conceal Welcome Mats and make it harder for Attacking Operators to notice.
- Frost works well with Bandit and Kaid. If an electrified set of Barbed Wire is placed on top of a Mat, any caught Attackers will die quickly.
- Smoke also works well with Frost, as Attackers can easily get caught in a well placed Welcome Mat as they attempt to push through Smoke's gas, eventually succumbing to its toxic effects while they are downed from the trap.
- Lesion is another Defender with a similar playstyle and gadget. If he is able to place his Gu Mine the right distance away from the trap, an incoming Attacker will get caught in the trap, with their leg triggering the Gu Mine, leading to a quick death.
  - However, if the Gu Mine is activated first, the Welcome Mat will then down the Attacker and cancel out the poison effects.
- As Frost's Welcome Mat places enemies in a downed state, Caveira will be able to interrogate them.
- Oryx can perform his dash on an unsuspecting enemy; if they land on a mat, it would instantly down them, allowing for him to quickly kill them.
- Thorn's Razorbloom Shells can be placed near the welcome mat, the timer will kill them without manual trigger.

### Counters

- Explosives can very easily destroy a Welcome Mat that's within their blast radius, but that depends on if all 100 health is depleted
- If swinging in from a window or vaulting over a Deployable Shield, an Attacker can quickly shoot a Welcome Mat with enough bullets to destroy it, preventing themselves from being trapped.
- Flores' RCE-Ratero can destroy Welcome Mats.
