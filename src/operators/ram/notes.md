# Ram

The Bu-Gi Drone is a soft-breaching device that can break through floors and barricades, soft walls that aren't reinforced.

## Gameplay Description

- Bu-Gi Drone will self detonate after 10 seconds of deployment.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Bu-Gi drone can be used to mask sound of loud actions, such as:
  - Deploying of Fuze's Cluster Charges
  - Amaru's Rappel Hook
  - Abilities of hard breach operators (Thermite, Hibana, Maverick and Ace)
  - Planting defuser
- Bu-Gi drone can clear Defenders gadgets, such as Mute's Jammers and observation blockers to help Twitch, Flores or Brava get their drone deeper inside objective.
- Fuze's Cluster Charge can force the defenders to move around, making it easier for Ram to pick them off.
- Lion's EE-ONE-D forces defenders to stand still or change making it easy to pick them off with the holes open by Bu-Gi.
- Nomad and Gridlock gadgets can prevent flank while Ram makes vertical holes.
- The Bu-Gi-Breachers also destroy Bulletproof Gadgets, Azami's Kiba Barrier and Castle' Armor Panel in their way.
  - However, this only works when the Bu-Gi is activated. Ram cannot throw them right through just like she can throw it through barricades.

### Counters

- Explosives, such as nitro cell and impact grenade can be used to destroy Bu-Gi.
- Bu-Gi can be destroyed by shooting it in the red tank on a back of it, similar to Mira's Black Mirror.
- Loud sound from Bu-Gi drone can mask foot steps of Caveira or Vigil.
- Mute's Jammer can jam Bu-Gi before it's been activated.
- Solis' SPEC-IO Electro-Sensor can detect Bu-Gi drone.
- Ram could easily be flanked since the BU-GI drone are very loud.
