# Ram

Ram's Unique Gadget is the BU-GI Automatic Breacher, an automated, bulletproof drone equipped with several cutting blades. Once deployed and activated remotely, the BU-GI will automatically move forward, destroying any destructible walls and flooring it touches. This can create several openings for Attackers, and make it easier to attack Defenders from above.

## Gameplay Description

- BU-GI Drone will self detonate after 10 seconds of deployment.
- BU-GI will also destroy any Deployable Shields and traps it encounters.

### Strategies/Synergies

- BU-GI drone can be used to mask sound of loud actions, such as:
  - Deploying of Fuze's Cluster Charges
  - Amaru's Rappel Hook
  - Abilities of hard breach operators (Thermite, Hibana, Maverick and Ace)
  - Planting defuser
- BU-GI drone can clear Defenders gadgets, such as Mute's Jammers and observation blockers to help Twitch, Flores or Brava get their drone deeper inside objective.
- Fuze's Cluster Charge can force the defenders to move around, making it easier for Ram to pick them off.
- Lion's EE-ONE-D forces defenders to stand still or change making it easy to pick them off with the holes open by BU-GI.
- Nomad and Gridlock gadgets can prevent flank while Ram makes vertical holes.
- The BU-GI-Breachers also destroy Bulletproof Gadgets, Azami's Kiba Barrier and Castle' Armor Panel in their way. However, this only works when the BU-GI is activated. Ram cannot throw them right through, just like she can throw it through barricades.

### Counters

- Explosives, such as nitro cell and impact grenade can be used to destroy BU-GI.
- BU-GI can be destroyed by shooting it in the red tank on a back of it, similar to Mira's Black Mirror.
- Loud sound from BU-GI drone can mask foot steps of Caveira or Vigil.
- Mute's Signal Jammer can prevent the activation of the BU-GI Auto Breacher. However, it will not deactivate the BU-GI once it is already activated, unlike other drones.
- Solis' SPEC-IO Electro-Sensor can detect BU-GI drone.
- Ram could easily be flanked since the BU-GI drone are very loud.
