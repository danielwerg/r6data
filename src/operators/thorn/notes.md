# Thorn

## Gameplay Description

Thorn's Unique Gadget is the Razorbloom Shell, a proximity grenade that can be thrown and attached to any surface. When deployed, any Attacker that enters its radius will start the Razorbloom's timer, followed by a powerful explosion a short moment later.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Razorbloom grenades work well with Defender gadgets that can slow down Attackers, such as Barbed Wire, Melusi's Banshee Device, Clash's Electro Shield, or Lesion's Gu Mines, preventing them from escaping the Razorbloom's explosive radius.

### Counters

- Razorbloom grenades can be destroyed from a distance by explosions, gunfire, and laser devices such as Twitch's Shock Drone and Zero's Argus Cameras.
- IQ can spot Razorblooms with her Electronics Scanner
- Razorblooms are an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
  - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
  - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
  - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
  - Destroyed by Twitch's Shock Drones
  - Destroyed by Zero's ARGUS Cameras
  - Hacked by Brava's Kludge drone
