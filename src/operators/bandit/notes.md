# Bandit

## Gameplay Description

Bandit's unique gadgets are four Crude Electrical Devices, a.k.a. Shock Wires. These devices send an electric charge through metallic gadgets and will damage those who come in contact.

- Bandit can connect his Shock Wires to all metallic gadgets, which include Barbed Wire, Reinforced Walls, and Deployable Shields.
  - The Shock Wire takes 2 seconds to deploy. (Enough to destroy Thermite's Exothermic Charge and other hard beaching gadgets).
  - Bandit deploys the Shock Wire on the ground next to the metallic gadget.
  - One Shock Wire can only shock one metallic gadget; adjacent metallic gadgets will not be affected, no matter how close they are to the Shock Wire.
  - The same metallic gadget can be shocked by multiple Shock Wires, but this will not stack its effects.
- An electrified gadget is visually identifiable by the small electric arcs being emanated off of the surface of the gadget.
- With a few exceptions, shocked objects destroy all electronic gadgets they come in contact with, unless it's a friendly gadgets.
  - Attacker Electronic Gadgets that can be destroyed by shocked objects:
    - Drones, including Twitch's Shock Drones.
    - Breach Charges
    - Hard Breach Charges
    - Thermite's Exothermic Charges
    - Hibana's X-KAIROS pellets
    - Ying's Candelas, but only when they're not properly activated yet.
    - Phones dropped when Dokkaebi is on the Attacking side.
    - Nomad's Airjabs
    - Iana's Gemini Replicator
    - Ace's SELMAs
    - Zero's Argus Cams
    - Flores' RCE-RATERO Drone
- Attackers touching a shocked object will take 3 damage roughly every third of a second (9 damage per second). Attackers will have their vision distorted and shout out as cues that they are being shocked. Defenders receive no damage in any way if they have direct contact with electrified objects.
  - Vaulting over an electrified Deployable Shield is considered as touching, thus the Attacking Operator will suffer damage.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Mute's Signal Disruptors work hand-in-hand with Bandit's Shock Wires in stopping or destroying Attacking gadgets during the game, especially against Drones during and after the Preparation Phase or Breach Charges during the Action Phase.
- Attackers caught in one of Frost's Welcome Mats can also be killed by an electrified Barbed Wire if it was over the gadget.
- Mira can safely place her Black Mirrors on electrified Reinforced Walls, potentially protecting her from hard breaching Attacker devices.

### Counters

- The Shock Wire is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
  - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
  - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
  - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
  - Destroyed by Twitch's Shock Drones
- Maverick's Breaching Torch can cut through Reinforced Walls, regardless whether or not it is electrified by a Shock Wire. As Shock Wires are required to be within close proximity of the Wall to work, they are especially vulnerable if the Breaching Torch cuts at the bottom.
- Due to the gadget having a very small setup effect, most Attackers would reason that the Shock Wires must be close to the source being electrified.
- Kali's LV Lances can destroy Shock Wires even through Reinforced Walls.
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy Shock Wires if deployed correctly.
- Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones allows him to destroy Shock Wires and prevent Bandit Tricking from safety.
- Brava's Kludge Drone will cause the shock wire to overheat and be destroyed instead of taking control of them, but will still be destroyed if contacting an electrified surface.
