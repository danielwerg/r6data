# Glaz

## Gameplay Description

Glaz's unique gadget is an HDS Flip Sight for his OTs-03 marksman rifle. While aiming down sights with it, it also comes with a Thermal Feedback System which can outline long-range marks even through smoke for easier shooting.

- Glaz spawns with the Flip Sight down. Pressing the gadget key will make Glaz flip up the Flip Sight, allowing its effects to apply when aiming down sights on the OTs-03.
- With the Flip Sight on, the OTs-03 has an increased level of zoom when aiming down sights.
  - The zoom is equivalent to a 4x zoom.
  - As an additional flip-up sight fitted behind the OTs-03's original sights/optics, the player's original sight reticles are retained when the Flip Sight is on.
- The Flip Sight features a Thermal Feedback System, highlighting any enemy players in sight in bright yellow, even through smoke.
  - The Thermal Feedback System is at full strength only when Glaz is standing still. Yellow bars visible on the side of the scope indicate if the Thermal Feedback System is active; when the bars are full, the system is at full strength. When the bars deplete, the system is weakened.
  - Any movement will cause the Thermal Feedback System to weaken, further reducing the visibility of yellow highlights and the visibility through smoke.
    - Continuously turning in one direction for over 90 degrees will cause the Thermal Feedback System to weaken.
  - The Thermal Feedback System is deactivated through 2.5 seconds of movement, and fully reactivates if Glaz stops moving for 0.5 seconds.
- The OTs-03 is one of the only weapons capable of destroying the otherwise bulletproof windows on the Presidential Plane, along with Kali's CSRX 300.
- The OTs-03 can penetrate 2 surfaces at once, allowing his rifle to pierce through non-reinforced walls (which are made up of two surfaces) with ease.
- Unlike other rifles, the OTs-03 can destroy unreinforced hatches and Barricades by firing 3 shots into them.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Glaz works well with any Attacker that comes equipped with a Smoke Grenade in their arsenal, allowing a wider range of coverage for Glaz to work with.
  - Capitão works especially well with Glaz because his Micro Smoke Grenades cover a much larger area than normal Smoke Grenades.
- Sens can cover Glaz with their R.O.U. Projector System, and Glaz is also the only attacker that can see through the ROU's light walls clearly, allowing him to target enemies while remaining in the R.O.U.'s cover.

### Counters

- Warden's Smart Glasses will be able to see through the smoke that Glaz may use.
- Jäger's ADS can intercept smoke grenades. Smoke grenades are a key part of Glaz's kit.
