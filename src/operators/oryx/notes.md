# Oryx

## Gameplay Description

Oryx's unique ability is the Remah Dash. When activated, he performs a quick dash, making him move faster than any other Defender for a short period of time. While dashing, Oryx can smash through Barricades and unreinforced walls, Osa's Talon Shields and Deployable Shields. He can also knock down any Attackers he dashes into, including shield bearers such as Montagne, Blitz and Fuze.

Oryx also possesses the ability to vault up through any open ceiling hatches, allowing him to ascend to higher levels quickly.

- Oryx's Remah Dash is powered by charges, recharging over time.
  - Oryx has a maximum of 3 charges. Colliding with soft walls and Barricades will not reset his charges. Dashing into Operators does not deal damage, unless they collide with a wall.
    - If Oryx dashes an enemy into a soft wall, the enemy will take 5 damage and have the same screen effect Oryx does when he runs into the wall.
    - If an enemy is hit by the Remah Dash they will be knocked back 2 meters, undergoing the same effect as Nomad's Airjabs.
  - Each charge is regained after a full 8 seconds.
  - Each Remah Dash lasts a full second and at the most, can cover 5 meters of ground.
  - Oryx's Remah Dash does not affect teammates and their gadgets unless he destroys a wall with friendly gadgets on it.
  - Oryx receives 5 points of damage whenever he smashes through a wall, and can down and even kill himself if he was already revived.
  - Recovery from colliding into an enemy and soft walls (along with general charges) are a half second.
  - Oryx can breach a maximum of 24 walls with all given health (if revived).
  - Dashing through a wall can open up an immediate line of sight for other Defenders to take advantage of.
  - When using his Remah Dash, Oryx can still be meleed even when he has direct contact into an enemy. This can only be achieved by the enemy meleeing Oryx in the chest.
- When ascending hatches, Oryx will hang on the ledge, allowing him the choice of either ascending or dropping back down. Jumping fully up a hatch takes 3.5 seconds.
  - Oryx makes noise when landing his hand for hanging and additional noise when climbing or landing on the ground when dropping back down
- While dashing and jumping up hatches, Oryx will not have access to his weapons for the duration and for a brief moment after, leaving him vulnerable for a short period of time.
- Oryx's Remah Dash and his ability to climb up hatches are completely independent of each other; he can climb up hatches no matter how many charges he has and it doesn't use up a charge or increase the time taken to replenish each charge.
- Charging into Barricades will not inflict any damage on Oryx, including Castle's Armor Panels, Osa's Talon Shields, or Deployable Shield.
- After breaking a wall with his Remah Dash, the screen will show a weak concussion-like effect that lasts for half a second.
- In the Bomb gamemode, if Oryx uses his Remah Dash on an Operator planting the Defuser, it will immediately force them out of the defusing process.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Doc's Stim Pistol can give Oryx more health to give more opportunities to use his Remah Dash, especially if there's a need to break through another wall.
- Oryx can use Thunderbird's Kóna Station to compensate for the HP loss after breaking through walls using his Remah Dash. Furthermore, a Kóna Station near an open hatch allows Oryx to heal by grabbing onto the hatch from below.
- Intel gathering Defender gadgets such as Valkyrie's Black Eyes or Bulletproof Cameras can scout ahead for Oryx, being able to see from above an open hatch or the other side of a wall.
- Oryx's Remah Dash is able to knock opponents into traps like Kapkan's EDDs, Frost's Welcome Mats, and Ela's Grzmot Mines.
- Clash's CCE Shield can assist Oryx by getting him close enough to ram down opponents and finish them off.

### Counters

- The Remah Dash can be interrupted by Gridlock's Trax Stingers, Zofia's Concussion Grenades, and Nomad's Airjabs.
  - The Trax Stringers will force Oryx to either destroy or walk through them.
  - The Airjabs will launch him back if he tries to go through its area of effect. If Oryx is low on health, this can possibly kill him if he hits a wall.
    - The Airjabs won't affect Oryx if he's currently hanging from the ledge of a hatch. It will activate as soon as he goes up or drops back down.
  - The Concussion Grenades will immediately stop Oryx mid-dash when hit.
- A well placed Claymore above a hatch will kill Oryx. Even simply hanging on the ledge will still trigger it. Placing a Claymore on an indestructible surface will prevent Oryx from destroying the Claymore, further cutting off his route from below.
- Lion's EE-ONE-D can track Oryx even when he's using a Remah Dash or moving up a hatch.
- Jackal can track Oryx's footprints whenever he's on the move and can discover his position easily.
