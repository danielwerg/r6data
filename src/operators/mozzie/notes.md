# Mozzie

## Gameplay Description

Mozzie is armed with the Pest Launcher, a slingshot that launches small robots called Pests that can hack the Attacking team's drones (including Twitch's Shock Drones and and Brava's Kludge Drones) and make them his own.

- Mozzie can only hack Attacker ground recon Drones (i.e. the gadgets specifically named Drones), including Twitch's Shock Drones. Echo's Yokai and Lion's EE-ONE-D are not such drones and do not interact with Pests.
- Mozzie can hack Attacker drones in two ways: Shoot the Pest directly onto the drone, or shoot it onto a surface and wait for a drone to get in its radius of 3 meters.
  - A Pest requires line of sight to the target drone in order to hack it.
  - Mozzie can pick up a deployed Pest to deploy it elsewhere.
  - A deployed Pest can be destroyed by any source of damage.
  - The target drone does not have to be actively used for it to be hacked; even a drone that is being thrown on deployment can be hacked by a Pest.
- Attacker drones will receive a red triangular warning symbol should they wander 4 meters to a deployed Pest.
- The hacking process takes 3 seconds to complete.
  - During this timing, it is still possible for attacker to perform a scan.
- Pests are electronic gadgets, and can thus be:
  - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
  - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
  - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
  - Destroyed by laser fired by Twitch's Shock Drones, if not already captured first.
- Each Pest can hack one drone and add it to Mozzie's fleet. After hacking a drone, a Pest self-destructs and cannot be retrieved.
  - A successful hack is indicated with a blue 3D pulse on Mozzie's screen, pulsing from the location of the hacked drone.
- Once a drone is hacked, Attackers lose control over the drone, and the drone is effectively destroyed to the Attacker who originally owned it. Mozzie can control the drone as if he were an Attacker.
  - A hacked drone is indicated to Defenders with a unique symbol, a distance indicator, and a white outline. They also display blue lights instead of red lights when actively used.
  - A hacked drone is unaffected by Barbed Wire or Mute's Signal Disruptors.
  - A hacked drone cannot be destroyed by electricity from Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.
  - If Mozzie hacks Twitch's Shock Drones, he is capable of using the laser to destroy Attacker gadgets and harass Attackers.
  - If Mozzie hacks Brava's Kludge Drones, he is capable of using the drone to target attacker's gadgets, causing them to self destruct, or turn their effects against attackers.
    - Any gadgets or observation tools (such as Echo's Yokai Drones, Maestro's Evil Eyes) that was hacked by Brava, but was 'hacked' again by Mozzie using Kludge Drones, the tool will return to their original owners control instead of Mozzie.
  - Nobody can pick up hacked drones.
- Though other Defenders can view the camera feed from hacked drones, Mozzie is the only Defender that can control the hacked drones.
- If Dokkaebi hacks a Defender's phone, Attackers will regain access to the camera feed of a hacked drone, but the drone will remain under Mozzie's control.
- If Mozzie drives a hacked drone outside for more than 10 seconds, he'll lose signal and the drone will be lost.
  - The drone cannot be used by either side for the rest of the round unless pushed back inside by another drone, in which case Mozzie regains control of it.
  - If a Pest jumps and captures a drone while they are still outside, the signal loss countdown immediately starts.

### Strategies/Synergies

- If Mozzie hacks Twitch's Shock Drones, he can use them as bait and could potentially distract Attackers, providing enough time for the other Defenders to launch an assault.
- Mozzie can put a Pest Drone above a drone hole to launch a surprise attack.
- Similar to Valkyrie, Mozzie can leave a drone in a site to observe Defuser planting, or Nitro Cell opportunities.
- Mute can jam drones and render them immobile, allowing them to be easily hacked by Mozzie.
- Mozzie can use a drone to block claymore's lasers.

### Counters

- IQ can use her RED to detect drones hijacked by Mozzie, as well as his Pests.
- Thatcher can use his EMP grenades to disable Pests as well as disable Mozzie's hacked drones for 15 seconds. Same goes for Impact EMP Grenades but it will only disable gadgets for 9 seconds.
- Twitch's drone can still use a laser to destroy a Pest, as long as it is not in the range of being hacked by it. The laser can also be used to destroy hacked drones.
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy both Pests and hacked drones.
- Kali's LV Lances can destroy both Pests and hacked drones.
- The latter applies to Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones, if they aren't captured.
- NÃ¸kk's HEL will remove her image from Mozzie's stolen drones. The hacked drones can still detect when she is nearby, however.
- Brava's Kludge Drone can hack the pest, as well as any previously hacked drones to turn its effects against Mozzie.
