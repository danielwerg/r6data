# Thunderbird

## Gameplay Description

Thunderbird's Unique Gadget is the Kóna Station, an automated dispenser which shoots out healing shots, similar to Doc's Stim Pistol. When deployed, the Kóna Station will target any damaged Operator who enters its radius, either Defenders or Attackers, and shoot a healing charge to heal them for 20 health.

- The Kóna Station can revive any downed Operators if they move into the Station's radius and manually activate the charge.
  - The revive charge a downed Operator receives can be activated anytime before they bleed out.
- Once the Kóna Station fires a single shot, it goes into a cooldown state and must recharge for 15 seconds before it can fire again.
  - Picking up the Kóna Station and deploying it again will automatically cancel the recharge time, similar to Jäger's ADS.
- The radius of the Kóna station is limited to 2 meters, so a player must be very close in order to be healed.
- Each station takes 3 seconds to fully deploy on a floor or surface.
- If multiple Operators enter its radius, the Station will automatically target the player with the lowest amount of health.
  - If both an Attacker and a Defender enter its radius, the Station will prioritize the Defender.
- The Kóna Station can heal through holes as long as an Operator is within its radius and line of sight. This also includes Drone Holes.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The Kóna Station works well with defensive gadgets such as Deployable Shields, Jäger's ADS or Wamai's MAG-NETs, allowing Defenders to create a strong defensive position.
- Oryx can use the Kóna Station to compensate for the HP loss after breaking through walls using his Remah Dash. Furthermore, placing a Kóna Station near an open hatch allows Oryx to heal by grabbing onto the hatch from below.

### Counters

- The Kóna Station can be destroyed or disabled by the following:
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades will disable the Kóna Station for 15 seconds.
  - Twitch's Shock Drone will immediately destroy the Kóna Station.
  - IQ can detect the healing stations and manually destroy them by gunfire.
  - Kali's LV Lances will destroy the stations if within range.
  - Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy the Kóna Stations easily.
  - Brava's Kludge Drone can overheat and destroy the Kóna Stations by hacking them.
  - Explosive damage, gunfire, and melee strikes will destroy the Kóna Stations.
