# Twitch

## Gameplay Description

Twitch can deploy up to two Shock Drones. The Shock Drones are specialized that can shoot lasers at a target. These drones can take out enemy gadgets from afar and shock enemies.

- Twitch deploys a regular Drone during the Prep Phase, which can be picked up and re-deployed during the Action Phase. Two Shock Drones are given during the Action Phase.
- The Shock Drones make a distinct, low-humming noise different from that of normal drones.
- Like normal drones, Shock Drones have lights installed in its front. When operated or viewed through by any Attacker, the lights will glow.
- Shock Drones can fire lasers that can destroy enemy electronic gadgets and deal small damage.
  - Both Shock Drones start with 3 lasers. Once a laser is used, they recharge one laser per 15 seconds.
  - Each laser deals 5 damage.
  - The laser has an unlimited range.
  - Most electronic gadgets (e.g. CCTV Cameras, Signal Disruptors, Nitro Cells) will be destroyed in one hit by the Shock Drone's lasers.
  - The lasers can destroy the gas canisters on Mira's Black Mirrors, thus opening the Black Mirror, as well as Goyo's Volcan Shields by hitting its red canister.
  - The lasers are incapable of disabling or interfering with Clash's CCE Shield.
  - The lasers can destroy Bulletproof Cameras by shooting at its weak point.
- Aside from the lasers and a larger hitbox, the Shock Drones otherwise function identically to normal drones, and are susceptible to the same gadget interactions.

### Strategies/Synergies

- As a Disabler capable of removing Bandit's or Kaid's electricity and Mute's Jammer effects, Twitch is able to assist Hard Breachers such as Thermite, Hibana, Ace or anyone who has access to the Hard Breach Charge.
- By destroying Mute's Signal Jammers, Twitch is able to
  - Allow teammates' Drones and Iana's Holograms to pass through certain areas, or remove the jammed effect from a teammate's Drone. This is especially valuable in the Preparation Phase.
  - Assist teammates with remote-detonated gadgets such as Breaching Charges and Fuze's Cluster Charge.
- Twitch works well with other Anti-Electronic Attackers, such as Thatcher and IQ when it comes to destroying them.

### Counters

- Twitch's Drones are still susceptible to Mute's Jammers, Bandit's Shock Wires and Kaid's Electroclaws if they get into effective proximity of them.
- Like for other drones, Vigil can avoid coming into sight of the Shock Drone with his ERC-7.
- Unlike other trap-based Operators, Frost's Welcome Mat cannot be damaged, thus destroyed, by the Shock Drone.
- Mozzie's Pests can hack Twitch's Drones, thus giving him full control over the drone.
- Maestro's Evil Eye can destroy Twitch's shock drones with its laser.
