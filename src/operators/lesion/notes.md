# Lesion

## Gameplay Description

Lesion comes equipped with his Gu Mines; poison mines that, once triggered by physical contact, cause the victim to be affected by a gradual loss of health until they are DBNO or the needle is removed. Up to 9 Gu Mines can be deployed, though access to them is staggered throughout the course of the round via a prep timer.

- Gu Mines are throwable devices that deploy on the floor and stick to any attacker who triggers them. They have an effective radius of 1 meter.
  - The Mine will trigger on one Operator but can affect multiple Operators if they are within the Gu Mine's area of effect.
    - Because of how they function, if an Attacker attempts to destroy it with a melee attack, it will detonate anyway.
  - Gu Mines will deploy as long as they are on a flat surface. This means that Lesion can deploy them on high surfaces, such as a desk or cabinet and even windowsills, and as long as Attackers come in contact with the Mines, they will trigger.
    - Occasionally, on any given set of stairs, a Gu Mine won't properly deploy as it will get snagged on a surface or have not enough room to deploy.
    - However, when in bookshelves or obstructed surfaces, they may not trigger.
  - Mines are retrievable, even after being deployed.
  - Gu Mines have a throwing profile similar to Impact Grenades. When a mine hits a wall or a ceiling, it falls nearly directly down but with a slight bounce.
- Getting affected by a Gu Mine causes a queasy visual distortion on the peripherals of the screen, and does damage over time as the needle remains inserted in the victim's leg. They can either fight through the disorientation and take the damage, or they can follow the on-screen prompt to remove the needle from their leg, lowering their gun and leaving themselves vulnerable for a couple seconds in the process.
- Getting stung by the needles deals 5 damage and followed by 12 damage periodically (2 seconds). Until removed, the needle will continue to deal its periodic damage.
  - While poisoned, an Operator cannot sprint.
    - An Operator can still prone, walk, crouch, and use their ability.
  - If another Gu Mine is triggered while one is already stuck, it will only refresh the poison timer. It will not increase the poison damage nor increase the number of needles that need to be pulled out.
  - In Bomb, if the Operator carrying the Defuser is poisoned, they cannot drop or plant their Defuser until they remove the needle.
  - Hostages will trigger the mine, but will receive no further damage than the first tick.
  - When downed, the poison effect will discontinue.
- There can be a total of 9 mines deployed. However, Lesion doesn't start with a full complement; he starts with 1 and acquires an additional 1 every 20 seconds thereafter. The 2nd one can be attained in the span of the Preparation Phase.
- Like other small, deployable gadgets, the Gu Mines will be destroyed if they are too close to any wall in the middle of reinforcement due to the collision.
- Stepping on GU Mine while being affected by another Gu Mine will reset the timer and deal damage instantly.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Because of their similar functions, Lesion works very well with the rest of the Trap-orientated Operators.
  - Kapkan and his EDDs works well with Lesion's Gu Mines in terms of enemy denial and discouragement. During this setup, caution must be taken to ensure that Gu Mines will not be destroyed by the EDD when it detonates.
  - Frost can work well with Lesion, if Lesion is able to place his Gu Mine the right distance away from the Frost's trap, an incoming Attacker will get caught in the Frost's trap, with their leg triggering the Gu Mine, leading to a quick death.
  - Ela and her Grzmot mines work very well due to the fact that her and Lesion's mines' effects do not overtake the other. This allows the possibility of an Attacker to be both disorientated and poisoned at the same time.
- Caveira can easily interrogate those that are downed from the Gu mines, provided the opportunity.

### Counters

- Gu Mines are still susceptible to gunfire and explosives.
