# Thermite

## Gameplay Description

Thermite is equipped with two Brimstone BC-3 Exothermic Charges. These charges can breach through any Reinforced Wall within three seconds of activation.

- Exothermic Charges can be deployed on any destructible surface, including reinforced ones.
  - Exothermic Charges have a roughly 3 second deployment animation, longer than that of the normal Breach Charges.
  - Exothermic Charges are remotely activated, so they cannot be activated if they or Thermite are in the effective range of Mute's Signal Disruptors.
  - Deployed Exothermic Charges are destroyable by any source of damage, including electricity from Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.
- When activated, Exothermic Charges play a roughly 3 second "heat up" animation and then explodes destroying surfaces, even reinforced ones, in a large area.
  - During this "heat up" time, the Exothermic Charges release visible sparks on both sides of the wall, and makes a loud sizzling noise, giving Defenders inside a clear warning to the breach.
  - The explosion radius on the Exothermic Charges is significantly larger than an average breaching charge. This explosion radius of 4 meters can also take out nearby walls or hatches when used properly.
  - The blast from Exothermic Charge is lethal, with damage drop-off radius around 3-4 meters
    - The blast is also lethal on the deployer side (at point blank), but the damage drop-off radius is much smaller.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Because of the long deployment time of the Exothermic Charges, the Gadget Deployment setting in the Controls section under the Options menu should preferably be set to Advanced, which will allow Thermite to cancel his deployment mid-animation.
- Because of the large explosion radius of the Exothermic Charges, they can destroy reinforced surfaces adjacent to the wall they are placed on. This can be used in certain situations to destroy a Reinforced Wall shocked or jammed by Bandit, Kaid, or Mute's gadgets, by detonating an Exothermic Charge on an adjacent, perpendicular wall that is not shocked or jammed.
  - This can also be applied in a few other ways: Detonating an Exothermic Charge on the floor next to a reinforced wall can destroy the bottom of the reinforced wall. Detonating an Exothermic Charge on a wall next to a reinforced hatch will destroy the hatch along with the wall.
- Thatcher can disable Signal Disruptors, Shock Wires, and Electroclaws, allowing Thermite to plant his Exothermic Charge.
  - Impact EMP can also disable Electronics, but with less efficiency.
- Twitch can also destroy Signal Disruptors, Shock Wires, and Electroclaws.
- Kali can aid Thermite by deploying her LV Lance before the charge is set down to clear anti-breaching gadgets.
- Zero's ARGUS Cameras can destroy Signal Disruptors, Shock Wires, and Electroclaws.
- Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones can blow up anti-breaching gadgets.
- Brava can destroy Shock Wires and Electroclaws, or convert Signal Disruptors. But this costs one of the three hacking charges

### Counters

- Bandit's Shock Wire can electrify reinforced walls. Thermite's Exothermic Charge will be instantly destroyed if it is on an electrified wall. Bandit can 'trick' Thermite's charge.
- Kaid's Electroclaws can electrify reinforced walls. Thermite's Exothermic Charge will be instantly destroyed if it is on an electrified wall. It is technically possibly for Kaid to 'trick' Thermite's charge if you are extremely fast.
- Mute's Signal Disruptor can stop Thermite's Exothermic Charge from triggering.
- Maestro's Evil Eye can destroy Thermite's Exothermic Charges with its laser.
- Exothermic Charges can be destroyed by Impact Grenades.
