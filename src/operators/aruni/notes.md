# Aruni

## Gameplay Description

Aruni's Unique Gadget is the Surya Laser Gate. When this device is launched onto a doorway, window hatch, or any kind of wall, it creates a laser grid which covers the entrance way, denying entry by the Attackers or destroying projectiles that try to pass through it.

- The Surya Gates automatically deactivate for a brief moment whenever Defenders step near them to let them through safely.
  - This does not work for Defender's gadgets. The Surya Gate will instead treat these projectiles like any other thrown projectile, destroying it and temporarily shutting off.
  - A Defender has to be within a vertical range of 1 meter for the Surya Gate to shut off.
  - The horizontal range for the Surya Gate to shut off is far less, enough for it to only switch off when a Defender is standing directly beside it.
- The Surya Gate is indestructible from all damage sources. Even when placed on a destructible wall, the Surya Gate will stick to the indestructible wooden beams of the wall.
- The Surya Gate can destroy any object or drone thrown through it, and does 30 damage to any Attacker that tries to move through it, regardless of Armor rating. Once it performs either of these effects, the Surya Gate will be deactivated for up to 30 seconds. Aruni can pick up any Surya Gate generators and reposition them elsewhere at any time.
  - To reactivate the Surya Gate generators, Defenders must wait for the generator to finish charging (indicated by the generator opening back up to reveal a pressure plate/switch), then shoot the generator to reactivate it. Attackers and laser-based Gadgets (Maestro's Evil Eyes and Zero's Argus Cameras) are also able to shoot the generator to reactivate the Surya Gate.
  - If Aruni were to pick up the Surya Gate it would reset the timer and be fully functional once it is placed again.
- Any type of projectile can disable a Surya Gate:
  - Frag Grenades
  - Smoke Grenades
  - Stun Grenades
  - Drones (including drones hacked by Mozzie)
  - Nitro Cells
  - Impact Grenades
  - Proximity Alarms
  - Projectiles fired from the GONNE-6
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades (can disable the Surya Gate for 15 seconds if the Grenade does not touch the lasers)
  - Smoke's Gas Canisters
  - Ash's Breaching Rounds
  - Twitch's Shock Drones (cannot directly disable the Surya Gate by shooting the generator either)
  - Doc's Stims from his Stim Pistol
  - Fuze's Cluster Charges (one Surya Gate will only take out one of the five sub grenades)
  - Tachanka's Shumikha grenades
  - Valkyrie's Black Eye Cameras
  - Capitão's Asphyxiating Bolts and Micro Smoke Grenades
  - Hibana's X-KAIROS Pellets
  - Echo's Yokai Drones (they won't touch the Surya Gate while on the ground, but will touch it when it jumps up)
  - Ying's Candelas
  - Lesion's Gu Mines
  - Zofia's Concussion Grenades and Impact Grenades
  - Ela's Grzmot Mines
  - Alibi's Prismas
  - Nomad's Airjabs
  - Kaid's Electroclaws
  - Gridlock's Trax Stingers
  - Mozzie's Pests
  - Kali's LV Lances (cannot deactivate the Surya Gate with its explosion, only by shooting directly into the Surya Gates)
  - Wamai's Mag-NETs
  - Iana's Gemini Replicator
  - Ace's SELMAs
  - Zero's Argus Cameras
  - Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones
- Whenever a Surya Gate is activated on a doorway, it covers the majority of the doorway, but leaves a small gap open at the bottom just like a Barricade. Attackers can use this gap to get drones through, or launch projectiles underneath the Surya Gate in order to clear defender utility.
- If there is a placeable Gadget (such as a Bulletproof Camera or Maestro's Evil Eyes) in the way of the Surya Gate's lasers, the Surya Gate will remain inactive until the wall or doorway is cleared. This includes when a Deployable Shield is placed in a way where it juts under the Surya Gate.
- Aruni also possesses an augmented melee attack through the use of punching with her prosthetic arm, this however has infinite uses.
- She is able to punch holes into walls, breaking any beams in the process and destroying each layer. Each punch makes a hole as large as being made by one of Hibana's X-KAIROS pellets.
- Aruni can create large sightlines and rotations in several seconds with no downside.
  - Aruni's punch can destroy hatches and Barricades all in one shot, including Castle's Armor Panels.
    - Aruni's punch can also destroy other gadgets, such as Drones and even friendly and enemy gadgets.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The Surya Gate can gain a mutual benefit from Castle's Armor Panels as the Surya Gates will be protected by the Armor Panels.
- Surya Gates can improve anti-breaching methods alongside Bandit, Kaid, and Mute by denying entry.
- Maestro can assist Aruni's Surya Gates by manually reactivating them when hitting the Surya Gate's generator.

### Counters

- Finka's Adrenal Surge can give her and other attackers some extra health, allowing them to risk charging through a Surya Gate without taking much damage.
- Operators who possess Gadgets that are multiple projectiles in one "canister" can use each individual projectile to disable a single Surya Gate, and still use the other projectiles to perform their task.
  - For example, each individual Trax Stinger deployed by Gridlock can effectively disable a Surya Gate without needing to sacrifice the whole Canister of Trax Stingers. Other Gadgets with this property includes Fuze's Cluster Charges, Hibana's X-KAIROS Pellets and Ying's Candelas.
- Iana can use her Gemini Replicator to take the Surya Gate's heat, disabling it for 30 seconds.
- Thatcher can disable the Surya Gate with his EMP Grenades for up to 15 seconds, but the Surya Gate will return to whichever state it was in afterwards. If a EMP grenade is thrown directly into the gate however, it will be disabled for 30 seconds.
- Impact EMP Grenades can disable Surya Gate for 9 seconds, hower it is better to throw them at it instead to disable it for 30 seconds instead.
- Osa could disable Surya Gate for 30 seconds using her Talon Shields.
