# Ying

## Gameplay Description

Ying comes equipped with her Candelas, specialized timed explosives which can either be thrown or anchored onto a breakable surface to shoot out seven flash charges into an area, temporarily blinding and deafening other affected Operators.

- Candelas have two deployment options.
  - It can be thrown as a Grenade.
  - It can be attached to soft destruction surface (wall, floor, barricade, Castle's Armor Panel) similar to Fuze's Cluster Charge.
    - Unlike Fuze's CLuster Charges, Ying's Candelas activate immediately after being deployed, depending on its timer.
- A Candela behaves differently from conventional grenades if thrown.
  - It can bounce walls and non-floor surfaces
  - It can only detonate on the ground.
  - It does not bounce the ground. Instead, it rolls along the path they came in contact with the ground.
    - If it came in contact with a ground obstruction, it rolls along the edge and try to roll forward along the edge.
- Candelas have a fuse charge timer, which can be adjusted by holding the grenade. The fuse timer only starts once the Candela hits the ground or is deployed.
  - If the grenade is instantly thrown or deployed, the fuse timer is 3 seconds.
  - The grenade can be cooked (held) for up to 3 seconds. For every second held to cook, a second is taken off the cook timer.
  - If the grenade is held for 3 seconds or more, the grenade immediately detonates once it hits the ground or deployed.
    - The rolling properties are not used if it instantly detonates when thrown and hits the ground.
  - The fuse timer are shown on HUD (as progressing circle sections) and the held Candelas themselves (as light dots).
- The grenade detonates into a series of six sub-grenades, with the flash pattern differing between the deployment modes.
  - If it is thrown, the sub-grenades detonate in a star pattern (six flashes at the corners and then one in the middle).
  - If it is placed on surface, the sub-grenades are fired onto the opposite surface (similar to Fuze's CLuster Charge, again) in a straight line pattern.
    - The first 5 flashes will be fired in a line from right to left with the 6th flash dropping in front of the Candela charge.
    - The 6th flash will detonate first, followed by the rest detonating in the order they are fired.
  - The six flashes are fired and detonated every fifth of a second. The sixth flash is fired exactly when the first flash detonates.
- The effective range of the Flash Charges is far larger in size than a regular Stun Grenade, as it can reach across entire hallways (over 10 meters).
  - However, the duration of each flash is half-a-second from such a distance, up to roughly 3 seconds at point-blank.
  - Effectiveness has been irregular due to how the flashes launch far and wide.
- A Candelas flash effect lasts for 1.4 seconds.
  - The maximum effectiveness of these Flash Charges is reached if the Operator is progressively flashed by all six flashes.
  - This requires no obstruction.
- Unlike normal grenades, Candelas can be destroyed by gunfire if they're shot before activation.
  - It can also be destroyed by Jäger's Active Defense System, or caught by Wamai's MAG-Net.
    - The sub-grenades can also be intercepted by Jäger and Wamai, if the main grenade detonated before it could be intercepted and the sub-grenade flew into the interception range.
- Ying wears special, electronic glasses that make herself immune to her own flashes,
  - It automatically activates once Ying pulls out her Candela.
  - It also automatically deactivates once the last sub-flash is detonated, or Ying retracts her Candela.
  - Ying is only immune to her own Candelas, not regular Stun Grenades or Blitz's Flash Shield.
  - Ying's Candelas can blind her teammates.
  - The glass is electronics.
  - The glass has a visual effect: a blue tint that can be seen from both herself and other Operators.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Thatcher, IQ, Twitch, Kali, Zero, and Flores, can be helpful allies when faced with a Jäger, as they can take out the ADS before it can take out Ying's Candelas.
- Fuze is a natural partner to Ying due to their similar functions. After Ying blinds enemies within with her Candela, Fuze can use his Cluster Charge to quickly take out the disoriented Defenders.
- Utility-wise, Capitão can be a good ally to maximize disorientating enemies with his Micro Smoke Grenades alongside Ying's Candelas. Also, Capitão can use his Asphyxiating Bolts to deal with disoriented Defenders.
- Candela place right under Aruni's Surya Gate will disable it.

### Counters

- Candelas can be shot and destroyed by bullets and explosions.
- Barbed Wire will slow down the Candelas' rolling speed.
- Jäger's Active Defense Systems are able to shoot down Candelas that come into range, thus preventing up to three flashes at the most.
  - Even if the Candela is allowed to dispatch its flashes, the ADS can still target each separate flash it sends out.
  - Conversely, Ying can disable all three Active Defense Systems through a well-placed Candela, provided all charges come in range of all of them.
  - Wamai's Mag-NETs can pull the Candelas elsewhere and detonate them.
- Aruni's Surya Gates can destroy the Candela, unless it rolls underneath the gap under the Gate.
- The Candelas can be destroyed by Bandit's Shock Wires.
- When activated, Warden's Glance Smart Glasses make him immune to the effects of the Candela. Even after being flashed, Warden can still activate the glasses to clear up the blinding effects and allow him to see normally.
- Ying's special glass that activates when she uses her Candelas is electronics.
  - It can be jammed by Mute's Signal Disruptor. If Ying moves into the range, she will be blinded.
  - It can be detected by Solis's Electric Sensor.
