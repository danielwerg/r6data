# Jackal

## Gameplay Description

Jackal's unique gadget is the Eyenox Model III, which can track enemy footprints and can identify its targets.

- The Eyenox is a visor. Jackal spawns with the visor up. Activating the gadget will have Jackal flip the visor down, activating its effects and downsides. The visor can be used to track footprints at nearly any time.
  - The Eyenox cannot be turned on or off while holding a Hostage.
- With the Eyenox active, Jackal can see and scan Defender footprints to track their owner. Scanning is activated by using the interact key on a footprint.
  - Scanning takes around 3 seconds.
  - Jackal can scan footprints within 8 meters of him.
  - Scanning requires Jackal to concentrate on a single set of footprints. If Jackal looks to another set of footprints, even if they belong to the same Defender, the scan will cancel.
- When the scan completes, the footprint's host will be tracked, immediately creating a 3D ping at their location. A new ping is created every 5 seconds for the duration of the tracking, which lasts 20 seconds, producing 4 pings total. Jackal can activate this ability 3 times and only once per Defender, meaning he can track up to 3 Defenders.
  - If the target, upon scanning, was not previously identified, then the Attacking team will all receive the identification point bonus.
  - Jackal and his current target will see the timer for when the next ping will be and how many are leftover.
  - Scanning a different set of footprints when tracking is underway will stop the previous tracking and begin a new tracking process on the new target.
- The Eyenox will produce temporary vision-disrupting static if Jackal takes damage with it active.
  - Shock damage from Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws will cause the entire view to be temporarily obscured in static.
- Mute's Signal Disruptors prevent the Eyenox from scanning footprints if Jackal is within their range. If the Eyenox is active, the Signal Disruptors will also produce vision-obscuring static that grows in intensity the closer to the Disruptor Jackal is.
  - This effect is similar to effect produce on drones when near but not disabled
- If Jackal tracks Caveira, the Eyenox will not produce 3D pings on Caveira's location when her Silent Step is active.
  - Regardless if 3D pings are created or not, Caveira will still be identified for the Attackers when Jackal begins the tracking.

### Footprint Mechanics

- Defenders create footprints whenever they move, standing or crouching. No footprint is made when the Defender crawls. Only Jackal can see these footprints when the Eyenox is flipped down.
  - Caveira will not create footprints while her Silent Step is active.
- Footprints are color-coded depending on their recency, starting in red at 0 seconds, becoming yellow at 20, light green at 45, light blue at 65, and disappear at 90.
- The death of a Defender will result in the immediate disappearance of all footprints from that Defender.
- There are four types of footprints, with each Operator having one of the four:
  - Type A: Mute, Doc, Valkyrie, Mira, Azami
  - Type B: Smoke, Castle, Pulse, Rook, Maestro, Clash, Mozzie, Warden, Oryx
  - Type C: JÃ¤ger, Bandit, Frost, Caveira, Echo, Lesion, Ela, Vigil, Alibi, Melusi, Aruni
  - Type D: Recruit, Kapkan, Tachanka, Kaid, Goyo, Wamai, Thunderbird, Thorn, Solis
- When playing Article 5, White Masks do not leave footprints behind, except for Bombers who leave Type D footprints. Jackal can still activate his ability and keep his visor on during the Hunt, but it is purposeless once the Bombers are eliminated.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The 8 meter scanning range allows Jackal to track footprints through broken flooring and hatches, but only from above.
- Due to the nature of his Eyenox being disrupted by Mute, Attackers such as Thatcher, Twitch, IQ, Kali, Zero, and Flores, can be helpful in removing Signal Disruptors.
- A well-timed scan from Lion's EE-ONE-D compliments Jackal's Eyenox scans, as the targeted victim will be inevitably detected by one or the other.
- Paired with Finka's Adrenal Surge, conflicting concussion and static effects are reduced for Jackal, allowing him to use his visor more freely. Also, since the Surge reduces ADS time as well, his PDW9 becomes extremely quick to aim down with.
- Since Gridlock can deploy her Trax Stingers from a floor above, and he also has a shotgun secondary at her disposal, she and Jackal work well together for intimidating and trapping Defenders from multiple angles.

### Counters

- The concussion effects of Echo's Yokai and Ela's Grzmot Mine will turn Jackal's Eyenox off and prevent him from using it for the effect's duration.
- Caveira's Silent Step allows Caveira to reduce the amount of footsteps and negate 3D pings from Jackal's tracking, allowing her to stay hidden even if Jackal tries to locate her. However, since the Silent Step has a shorter duration than the Eyenox scans, it is sometimes impossible for a Caveira to completely avoid being pinged if she is already being scanned.
- Mute's Signal Disruptors can interfere with Jackal's tracking and scanner.
