# Thatcher

## Gameplay Description

Thatcher is equipped with three EG MKO-EMP Grenades. These grenades disable all electronics that are within its area of effect.

- When an EMP Grenade is tossed, they will let out an electromagnetic pulse after 3 seconds, disabling defender gadgets caught within its 5.2 meter radius for 15 seconds.
  - EMP Grenades use a regular grenade throwing profile.
  - Unlike Frag Grenades, EMP Grenade cannot be cooked.
  - The EMP will not affect any Attacker gadgets.
  - The EMP passes through surfaces, allowing Thatcher to disable devices on the other side of a wall.
  - EMP Grenades are unaffected by electricity, so throwing an EMP grenade directly at an electrified wall will not destroy the EMP grenade.
  - EMP Grenades are unaffected by Mute's Signal Jammers.
  - Like other throwable objects, hitting an Operator directly with an EMP Grenade will deal a minor amount of damage of 5 hit points.
  - The EMP Grenade can be intercepted by Jäger's ADS and Wamai's Mag-NETs.
- Aside from Gadgets, the EMP also affects some defender weapon attachments caught in its radius:
  - Defender Electronic Sights (i.e. Red Dot Sight, Reflex Sight, Holographic Sight) caught within the EMP radius will be disabled for 15 seconds, during which their reticle will disappear.
  - Defender Laser Sights will be disabled for the same duration, with a corresponding decrease in hipfire accuracy.
- Thatcher gets points for destroying and disabling gadgets, allowing an EMP grenade to function as a proximity sensor against Pulse and Vigil.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Thermite, Hibana, and Ace benefit the most from pairing with Thatcher, as their biggest obstacle tends to be Mute's Signal Disruptors or Bandit's Shock Wires and Kaid's Electroclaws when it comes to destroying Reinforced Walls.
  - The benefits also extend to other Operators whose gadget can be disrupted by the Signal Disruptors, such as Blitz's Flash Shield.
- Thatcher pairs well with Attacking operators tasked with dealing with electronics:
  - IQ can help Thatcher to see through walls electronics. With her Electronics Detector, she can ping to where the electronics are most clustered to get the best out of Thatcher's EMP Grenades.
  - Twitch can help in destroying individual electronic gadgets to help Thatcher reserve his EMP grenades for large clusters of electronics.
  - Kali can work in tandem with Thatcher in dealing with electrified gadgets (together with Mute's Signal Disruptors).
  - The latter applies to Zero and Flores.

### Counters

- The EMP Grenade does not affect mechanical devices such as Frost's Welcome Mat.
- Because they are still grenades, Jäger's Active Defense Systems will eliminate chucked EMP Grenades out of the air, preventing defending gadgets from being destroyed or disabled. However, this only applies to when the Magpies have a line of sight of the Grenade, and can still be disabled through walls and other surfaces.
  - Wamai's Mag-NETs can also catch EMP Grenades, redirecting them to a location that was not intended by the Thatcher.
  - EMP Grenades thrown into Aruni's Surya Laser Gates will be intercepted.
- While his Yokai Drone can be disabled temporarily, some ceilings Echo's Drone can attach to are high enough to avoid being affected by Thatcher's Grenades.
- EMP grenades cannot disable Goyo’s Volcán Canisters as they are just explosives sealed within a bulletproof case.
