# Buck

## Gameplay Description

Buck's unique gadget is an underbarrel shotgun mounted under his weapon known as the "Skeleton Key", otherwise designated as the SK 4-12. The shotgun has a higher destructive potential than any of the other shotguns.

- Using the special gadget button (PC: MMB) will switch between Buck's current firearm and the attached Skeleton Key underbarrel shotgun, limiting the underbarrel options. The Skeleton Key operates like any other firearm.
  - The Skeleton Key is semi-automatic
    - It holds 5 + 1 shells with 25 more shells in reserve.
  - The Skeleton Key is not considered as a gadget with unique ammo, so ammo boxes in respective gamemodes will refill its reserves.
  - The Skeleton Key has low recoil and can easily destroy walls and eliminate enemies.
    - The Skeleton Key is significantly more destructive than other shotguns, with each pellet able to destroy large pieces of a destructible surface.
  - The Skeleton Key has a maximum damage of approximately 60 per pellet. Compared to other shotguns, the Skeleton Key's damage drop-off is greater, reaching 15 damage per pellet by 14m.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Buck, much like Sledge, is an Operator meant for quick breaches, as his Skeleton Key is able to break through non-reinforced surfaces better than any other available shotgun in the game.
- Due to its superior destructive capabilities, firing the Skeleton Key from a bit farther away from a surface is a viable tactic in spreading pellets out more for larger holes (3-5 meters).
- The Skeleton Key, while not meant to be used for combat, can deal some quick shotgun damage at close range. Its effective range is very short however.
- The Skeleton Key can destroy floors above and below an objective in order to effectively take out gadgets and enemies.
