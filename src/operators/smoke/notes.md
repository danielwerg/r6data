# Smoke

## Gameplay Description

Smoke is equipped with three Compound Z8 Remote Gas Grenades, remotely detonated gas canisters that will damage and possibly kill whoever it comes in contact with.

- Gas Grenades are thrown by Smoke and stick onto surfaces they touch. Once activated, the Grenade will release a toxic gas cloud that is 5 meters in diameter.
  - Gas Grenades have a light throwing profile similar to Impact Grenades.
  - Gas Grenades can be detonated anywhere at any time. However, the only exception is if a Gas Grenade is still deployed after Smoke dies.
  - The gas cloud is 3.6m in a diameter.
  - The gas cloud primarily spreads parallel to the surface that the grenade is attached to. The cloud will not spread perpendicularly, and will not spread to areas behind it. The surface area of the gas cloud is similar to an actual Smoke Grenade.
  - Like normal smoke grenades, the Gas Grenade will only let pinging target the gas cloud.
  - The Gas Grenade is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
    - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
    - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
    - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
    - Destroyed by lasers fired by Twitch's Shock Drones
    - Destroyed by Kali's LV Lances, Zero's ARGUS Cameras, and Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones
- The gas cloud is a translucent yellow, and physically acts like a Smoke Grenade cloud, blocking vision in the given area.
- The gas cloud deals 15 points of damage every two-thirds of a second, regardless of the Operator's Health and Speed rating. A gas cloud can down an Operator at full health in just over three seconds.
  - Attackers under the effects of Finka's Adrenal Surge will take double the damage (60 points of damage per second) from the gas cloud. This means that an Operator at full health under the effects of Adrenal Surge will be downed in just two seconds.
- The gas cloud lasts 10 seconds before dissipating.
- Even after the gas cloud is dissipated the cloud will linger for a couple seconds after and only obscure minimal vision. At this point, it won't deal any damage.
- Smoke is the only Operator immune to the gas cloud; all other characters, including Attackers, Defenders, and the Hostage, will take damage inside the gas cloud.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Smoke works well with Frost's Welcome Mat. The Welcome Mat's victims are unable to move while Smoke's Gas Grenades finish the job.
- The latter also applies to Lesion's Gu Mines, when given the opportunity.
- Melusi's Banshees provide as an oppressive gadget and can force Attackers into taking more damage from the Gas Grenades.
- Warden's Glance Smart Glasses can be paired with the gas to create a one way angle holdout.

### Counters

- Due to Smoke's Gas Grenades utilizing a remote control to detonate, it is susceptible to the same disadvantages as other electronic gadgets.
  - IQ can find and destroy the Gas Grenades with her Electronics Scanner.
  - Thatcher is able to disable any Gas Grenade that has yet to detonate with his EMP Grenades for a duration of 15 seconds.
  - Impact EMP Grenades will disable Gas Grenade for 9 seconds.
  - Twitch's Shock Drone can scout for any Gas Grenade and destroy it from a safe distance.
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy Gas Grenades, if with precision and quick timing.
- Kali and Flores can also destroy Gas Grenades.
- The Thermal Feedback System on Glaz's OTs-03 can see through Smoke's Gas Grenades.
