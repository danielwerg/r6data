# Deimos

## Gameplay Description

Deimos' unique gadget is the "DeathMARK", a small helicopter-shaped drone that is able to track any identified defender. Deimos can choose from any identified defender, and have a DeathMARK track their exact location, with the drawback of also revealing his location to whoever he is tracking. This location tracking gives Deimos a constant 3D ping and a constant readout of what room his target is in. The Operator getting tracked also gets a 3D ping (albeit delayed), but does not get a readout of what room Deimos is in. Along with revealing his location, Deimos is not able to use his primary weapon while a DeathMARK is deployed. If Deimos have either of his primary weapons out while choosing a target, Deimos will automatically holster his primary weapon and pull out Deimos' unique .44 Vendetta secondary. When an Operator is selected to be tracked by a DeathMARK, ALL players receive a notification at the top of the screen (in a similar position to Lion's drone scan icon), displaying the text "OPERATOR has been targeted by Deimos". It should be noted that only Deimos and his target get their respective pings. No other players are able to see them.

The DeathMARK lasts 20 seconds, but can be manually cancelled by Deimos if he so chooses. Deimos begins with 1 DeathMARK at the start of a round, and slowly gets more as the round goes on, similar to Lesion's Gu Mines. From the time that Deimos chooses his target and the notification is sent out, there is a short pause (about 3 to 4 seconds) while the DeathMARK flies to the location, and then it begins tracking. DeathMARKs also cannot be destroyed by any Operator.

Deimos favors a methodical yet fast playstyle, and is able to directly go toe-to-toe with most roaming defenders, along with being able to directly counter most flanks (not counting Vigil). Deimos works exceptionally well with other recon operators, such as Jackal and Lion, and is a must-pick for any player who is good at communicating.

### Strategies/Synergies

- If an Operator is in an area where a DeathMARK cannot access the selected Operator (such as standing near one of Mute's Signal Disruptors), Twitch's Shock Drone can be used to destroy said Disruptor, cancelling that counter. Zero's ARGUS camera's lasers can also destroy said counters.
- Dokkaebi and Brava's abilities to hack defenders' cameras can also represent a great source of intel-gathering to scan and identify more targets for Deimos to hunt down.
- If there are no identified defenders by the time Deimos begin a round, Jackal's Eyenox can assist in giving Deimos some ground to use his DeathMARK. Lion can also get a similar effect, as his EE-ONE-D is able to automatically identify anyone pinged by it.
- If the person on your team using Deimos is a good communicator, they can keep your team updated on exactly where their target is, giving you an added layer of intel, and allowing for potential team ambushes on his target.

### Counters

- Deimos won't be able to track Defender while they are in the radius of the Mute's Signal Disruptors. If Defender already being tracked, and enter the perimeter of a Disruptor, the DeathMARK will be unable to track them, and the duration of that specific DeathMARK will be paused. However, as soon as they exit the perimeter of the Disruptor (provided Deimos hasn't cancelled it), the DeathMARK will immediately resume tracking them. This same effect applies to Tubar√£o's Zoto Canisters as well.
- Deimos cannot target Defenders that have not been scanned by a drone of any type, and haven't been identified by any means.
- Vigil's ERC-7 Video Disruptor outright nullifies the effect of Deimos' DeathMARKs. If the ERC-7 is active when a DeathMARK is about to be deployed, Deimos will be unable to begin tracking Vigil.
- EMPs from Bulletproof Cameras used on Deimos are able to disrupt the tracking of any active DeathMARKs.
- If one of these above counters is activated while the DeathMARK is still finding Defenders location and hasn't begun to track yet, the tracking will be cancelled, and that DeathMARK will be refunded to Deimos.
- When using this ability, Deimos can only use a secondary weapon. If the secondary weapon runs out of ammo, the Operator can only use a melee attack while using the ability.
