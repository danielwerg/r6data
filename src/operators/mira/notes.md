# Mira

## Gameplay Description

Mira can punch her Black Mirrors through walls, reinforced or not, to create a one-way view to the other side. This allows her and her teammates to look out from the safety of the air-compressed glass. If the Defender attending the Black Mirror wants, they can break the gas canister to create for themselves a murder hole.

- Mira spawns with two Black Mirrors. She can deploy her Black Mirrors on any breachable or reinforced wall, and she can even place them over the border between a reinforced and non-reinforced wall.
  - The Black Mirror is a bulletproof one-way window; it is see-through only from the side it was deployed from. The Black Mirror appears as an opaque black glass on the opposite side.
  - A single melee strike on either side of the Black Mirror will shatter it, completely obstructing any lines of sight through the Mirror. However, it can still be manually ejected by destroying the gas canister.
  - A deployed Black Mirror ejects the section of the wall/reinforced wall that it is deployed on.
  - Mira can deploy a Black Mirror while crouching or standing, but cannot set down Black Mirrors when prone.
  - Deploying a Mirror takes 5 seconds.
  - Once deployed, Black Mirrors cannot be manually removed.
  - Mira can only deploy a Black Mirror on the deployed side of a reinforced wall.
  - Non-reinforced walls cannot be reinforced if a Black Mirror was deployed first.
  - Thermal breaching gadgets, i.e. Thermite's Exothermic Charges, Hibana's X-KAIROS pellets, Ace's SELMAs, and Maverick's Breaching Torch, can still be used on the opaque side of the Black Mirror.
- A gas canister is located on the bottom frame of the deployment side of a Black Mirror. The gas canister can be destroyed by gunfire, melee, explosives, or lasers fired by Twitch's Shock Drones. Once destroyed, The Black Mirror will eject their bulletproof window after a 4-second delay, creating a viewing port that players can shoot through.
  - The gas canister can be destroyed by Wamai's Mag-NETs and Goyo's Volc√°n Shields.
  - Breaking the canister releases a small puff of smoke and a soft noise that can be heard on both sides of the Black Mirror.
  - After the Black Mirror is ejected, the Black Mirror's frame will still remain.
- There are four anchors on the Black Mirror, two located at the top side and two on the bottom. Should they be destroyed by a thermal breaching gadget, the black mirror will be instantly and completely destroyed, not leaving behind a frame.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Some specific maps have locations that allow Mira to place her Black Mirror at an elevated height allowing placing two windows on the same wall.
- If both Black Mirrors are deployed on two separate reinforcements then one can be ejected and the other can remain untouched.
- Mira can deploy a Black Mirror on a reinforced section of a wall and leave the neighboring section unreinforced, creating opportunities for easy penetration kills. Blasting holes on the unreinforced section can also allow Nitro Cells to be thrown through.
- Mira works well with Operators like Mute, Bandit and Kaid, as their gadgets are able to prevent Attacker gadgets from destroying the Black Mirrors if deployed on a reinforced wall.
- If it is impossible to destroy fusing hard breach gadget on Black Mirror it is advised to shot the canister to minimize the breach.
- Azami's Kiba Barrier can be placed on a nearby soft wall to prevent getting shot.

### Counters

- Hitting the Black Mirror from either side with a melee strike will deny any lines of sight through it.
- Twitch's Shock Drone is capable of shooting its lasers and destroy Black Mirrors' gas canisters.
- Thermite, Hibana, Ace, and Maverick's gadgets, when used on a reinforced wall with the Black Mirror, will destroy the Black Mirrors.
  - If the Black Mirror is deployed on a non-reinforced wall, destruction of the wall around the Black Mirror will remove the Black Mirror with it. Ash's breaching rounds can easily destroy such a Black Mirror from a distance.
- Because of the nature of the Black Mirrors, Blitz and Ying, as well as any Attacker with a Stun Grenade, are still able to blind Defenders through them.
- Maverick's Breaching Torch can take out the locks of the Black Mirror, destroying it instantly provided he knows where they are exactly located.
  - Maverick can also create a small hole underneath the Black Mirror, allowing him to shoot the gas canister and eject the black mirror easily.
- If deployed correctly, Ace's SELMAs will be able to destroy the Black Mirror and provide a larger view port.
- Zero's ARGUS Camera lasers will destroy the Black Mirrors' gas canister if within view.
