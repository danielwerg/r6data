# Caveira

## Gameplay Description

Caveira possesses the "Silent Step" skill, which enables her to sneak up on enemies to immobilize them. Once they are down for the count, she can "Interrogate" them to reveal their teammates' locations.

Caveira's "ability" is made up of three parts: her Silent Step, her special handgun, the "Luison", and her ability to "Interrogate" downed enemies.

### Silent Step

Silent Step, as its name indicates, allows Caveira to move quietly, making it nearly impossible to detect her movements by sound.

- The Silent Step ability runs on a charge system; it has infinite uses but limited duration and charge. It can be manually deactivated while active.
  - Silent Step can be active continuously for up to 10 seconds.
  - Silent Step recharges when it is deactivated. The recharge rate is twice as fast as the depletion rate, so the maximum recharge time is 5 seconds.
  - Caveira can activate Silent Step as long as it is at least 25% charged.
- While Silent Step is active, Caveira gains the following attributes:
  - Caveira's movement sounds are greatly reduced.
  - Caveira is restricted to using her sidearm.
  - Caveira's vision is tinted green.
  - Caveira adopts a hunched stance in third person.
  - Caveira's melee attacks on non-downed enemies will guarantee a down; melee attacking downed enemy will still kill as usual.
  - Caveira does not leave behind any footsteps that Jackal can see and track using his Eyenox.
    - Caveira still leaves behind footprints as normal when Silent Step is not active, and activating Silent Step does not erase any of Caveira's footsteps.
    - Caveira's location is not pinged if Jackal tracks Caveira with the Eyenox.
      - If Silent Step deactivates, Caveira can still be pinged.
- Silent Step is automatically deactivated if Caveira switches back to her primary or uses her secondary gadgets, reinforces walls or hatches, or puts up barricades.
  - Interrogating and firing her sidearm will not.

### Luison

Caveira's "Luison" pistol has several properties that allow Caveira to incapacitate her target discreetly.

- The Luison uses a permanently attached silencer that is more effective than other silencer attachments.
  - The gun features an above-average damage rating of 65, together with an extended damage drop-off than other pistols (from 12 to 35 meters), dropping down from 12 meters, down to 13 damage by 35 meters of distance.
  - It also guarantees to place Operators into a DBNO state, even if they were shot in the head.
    - An exception to this rule is when an Operator was previously downed. In this case, the Luison will simply kill the Operator like any other weapon.
    - Shooting a downed Operator again with the handgun will kill them.
  - Magazine and ammo size are similar to any handgun. Magazine size is 12 + 1, total ammo is 91 rounds.

### Interrogation

The ability Interrogation allows Caveira to interact with downed attackers and receive the live location of the enemy's allies.

- Using Interrogation causes Caveira to interrogate the downed Attacker and then kill them in five seconds. The Interrogation requires the player to hold down the interaction key. Caveira is vulnerable in this state as she is forced to look down at her target and cannot react unless she stops interacting.
  - The Interrogated target cannot move while being interrogated and is forced to look down while in this state.
- Upon successful Interrogation, all currently alive Attackers will have their identity not only compromised but are also tagged for ten seconds, showing their Operator symbol above their head.
  - Attackers are immediately alerted by a flashing "LOCATION REVEALED BY CAVEIRA" message on their HUD. One of Caveira's Interrogation dialogues will also be heard by the entire Attacking team.
- Attackers are unable to escape the Interrogation after Caveira begins the process.
  - An Attacker can stop the Interrogation by killing either Caveira or the victim. However, having the victim quit the match (causing their bodies to disappear) will not prevent an ongoing Interrogation, and the effects will still apply.
- From the Attacker's point of view, their DBNO bleed out timer disappears alongside being pinned down when being interrogated.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Valkyrie can help Caveira by landing one of her Black Eye cameras in a location that Caveira can use advantageously for a flanking maneuver.
- Caveira works well with any operator whose gadgets guarantee downing their victims.
  - Frost's Welcome Mat catches Attackers and places them in a DBNO. Said Attackers are vulnerable to Caveira's Interrogation.
  - If an Attacker takes lethal damage from Lesion's Gu Mines, the attacker will go into a DBNO with the poison removed.
- Ela's Grzmot mine works well with other roamers, as it helps make combating incoming attackers easier.
- The latter applies to Echo's Yokai Drones.

### Counters

- Jackal will track Caveira if her Silent Step is not timed well enough with his Eyenox scans.
- Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb will cause Caveira's phone to ring, revealing her position.
- Lion can detect Caveira with his EE-ONE-D drone, regardless if she was moving with her Silent Step activated or not.
- Gridlock's Trax Stingers can cut off Caveira's flanking routes, forcing her to choose another route of travel or to reveal her position by destroying the spiked patches.
- Nomad's Airjabs can give away Caveira's position and allow Attackers to take advantage of it.
- The victim of hers can crawl under a table to prevent interrogation.
- Caveira cannot begin an Interrogation if the target is in the process of being revived by Finka's Adrenal Surge.
