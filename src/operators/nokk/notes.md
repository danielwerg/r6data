# Nøkk

## Gameplay Description

Nøkk's unique gadget is the HEL Presence Reduction Device, a gadget that when activated, erases her image from cameras. This, however, comes with some limitations.

- The HEL has infinite uses and runs on charge. The HEL lasts for 30 seconds, with the maximum recharge time being 30 seconds. Nøkk can activate HEL Step as long as she has 25% of the bar charged.
- HEL has 1 second cooldown between uses.
- With the HEL active, Nøkk become invisible to observation tools, similar to Vigil, but she will not show the white static vignette around the screen.
  - Nøkk will be visible on any camera as distortion glitches if she sprints, fires weapons, moves through Barbed Wire, takes damage, melee Barricades, flashed, pushed or performs any actions such as pulling out Lesion's Gu Mine. Nøkk will know when she is glitching as the peripherals of her screen will have a yellow interference.
  - Reloading, swapping weapons, walking and crouching will not cause the mosaic glitches.
  - The cameras on Echo's Yokai Drone and drones hacked by Mozzie can see a border interference wave effect similar to Vigil's ERC-7 when Nøkk is nearby with the HEL on. All other cameras cannot see this effect.
  - Just like Vigil, environmental debris can reveal where Nøkk may be as they move upon being trampled.
  - Like Vigil, affected surveillance tools will emit a white light instead of the color set for the opposing team.
  - Nøkk will not trigger the tracking from Alibi's Prismas when she moves through or attacks their volumetric displays.

### Counters

- Nøkk will trigger Proximity Alarms when she enters the effective radius, regardless of her gadget being active or not.
- Pulse's Heartbeat Monitor will detect Nøkk even with her HEL active.
- Solis' SPEC-IO Electro Sensor is able to detect the HEL when active.
- Melusi's Banshee will interfere with her gadget and give away her silent approach.
- Kapkan's EDDs will give away Nøkk's position.
- Lesion's Gu Mines give the same effect of the latter.
- Ela's Grzmot Mines can also give away Nøkk's position.
- Alibi's Prisma will still ping Nøkk when she moves through or attacks their volumetric displays, but she can prevent being pinged by activating her the HEL gadget.
