# Zero

## Gameplay Description

Zero's gadget is the ARGUS Launcher, which launches small cameras. These cameras can burrow into any surface, including reinforced walls and hatches, and provide a camera view on both sides of the deployed surface.

Each ARGUS Camera can fire an unlimited amount of projectiles, which can be used to destroy Defender gadgets and defences, or injure defenders themselves.

- The ARGUS Camera's lasers have a recharge rate of 15 seconds with only 1 shot before having to recharge.
- The ARGUS Launcher is considered a separate weapon like Amaru's Garra Hook.
  - Zero is exposed when using the ARGUS Launcher.
  - In order to access whichever weapon you were using before, you must hit the switch weapon button.
- The ARGUS camera reticle displays two arrows facing upwards and downwards whenever the camera is able to view both sides of the desired surface; If only the downards arrow displayed, the camera will only view one side; If no arrows are displayed, the camera will not land on a surface.
- ARGUS cameras can drill into indestructible walls and floors, but will only see one side.
- ARGUS cameras can drill into any surface unless electrified by Bandit or Kaid.
  - Once deployed, the ARGUS Camera's feed becomes accessible by all Attackers.
  - Zero can fire a laser from the ARGUS Camera. This cannot be done by any other Attacker.
  - An ARGUS Camera's laser deals 5 damage.
  - To fire a laser would be with the same button as firing any other weapon.
  - The laser can travel forever as it does not have a maximum distance.
  - In order to switch the view on an ARGUS Camera you must press the prompted key.
  - Each ARGUS Camera can view both side of the wall in a 180 degree span.
  - ARGUS Cameras after launch will drill into any surface immediately upon impact.
  - The camera won't pierce the surface automatically.
  - The piercing action can only be initiated by Zero and only when controlling a deployed Argus Camera.
  - Once the camera has pierced a surface, any living attacker can swap sides.
  - ARGUS Cameras can be destroyed by any source of damage on either side of the wall.
  - When destroyed, an ARGUS Camera will not leave behind any openings but rather what appears to be scratches on the surface of both sides.
  - Any ARGUS Cameras will give a static screen if caught within any of Mute's Signal Jammers and using any means of the camera will be rendered useless, including the laser function.
- The ARGUS Camera's lasers can destroy any of the following Defender gadgets:
  - Smoke's Gas Canisters
  - Mute's Signal Jammers (if out of effective radius)
  - Kapkan's Entry Denial Devices
  - Jäger's Active Defense Systems (if not destroyed when launched)
  - Bandit's Shock Wires (if not destroyed when deploying)
  - Valkyrie's Black Eyes
  - Echo's Yokai Drones
  - Mira's Black Mirror Gas Canisters
  - Lesion's Gu Mines (if seen)
  - Ela's Grzmot Mines
  - Maestro's Evil Eyes (if open)
  - Alibi's Prismas
  - Kaid's Electroclaws (if not destroyed when deploying)
  - Mozzie's Pests and Mozzie's Captured Drones
  - Goyo's Volcan Canister (only the fuel canister)
  - Wamai's Mag-NETS (if not grabbed when launched)
  - Nitro Cells
  - Proximity Alarms
  - CCTV Cameras
  - Bulletproof Cameras (Only when fired at its weak point)

### Strategies/Synergies

- Zero works well with breachers such as Thermite, Hibana an Ace as he can use ARGUS cams to scout ahead in a room, and take out any gadgets which disrupt breaching tools.
- Zero's ARGUS cams make a fairly loud noise upon deploying, as such, any operator with a gadget or secondary gadget that can mask this will help with this, such as Thermite and Fuze's charges or Thatcher's EMP grenades.
- IQ can help Zero locate Defender gadgets with her Electronics Detector, allowing him to destroy them far easier from a distance with the ARGUS Cameras.
- Twitch alongside Zero's ARGUS Cameras can effectively clear a room of enemy gadgets.

### Counters

- When an ARGUS cam is deployed, it makes a distinctive sound when burrowing into a wall or floor, alerting Defenders of an ARGUS deployment. Along with a noticable light that can be spotted when an ARGUS camera is being used.
- As ARGUS cams are considered projectiles, they can be intercepted by Jäger's ADS and Wamai's Mag-NETs.
- ARGUS cams are destroyed if deployed on a surface electrified by Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.
  - Electrifying gadgets can be destroyed by the ARGUS' laser, if deployed at a safe distance.
- Mute's Signal Disruptors can prevent ARGUS cams from operating.
- Maestro's Evil Eye can destroy Zero's cameras.
