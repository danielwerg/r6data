# Maestro

## Gameplay Description

Maestro comes equipped with two Compact Laser Emplacements (CLE-Vs), otherwise known as his "Evil Eyes". These gadgets are bulletproof, gyroscopic and can see through smoke. The laser functions of the Evil Eyes will cause it to become vulnerable as it opens up, but will unleash low-damage but rapid laser shots for a few seconds before overheating and automatically closing itself.

- The Evil Eyes can be deployed on any solid surface, similar to Bulletproof Cameras and Jäger's Active Defense Systems.
  - As an emplaced gadget, the Evil Eye will be destroyed if the surface it is deployed on is destroyed. This applies when placed on the other side of reinforced walls, as the turret is connected to the wooden wall; destroying the wood, in this case, will cause the Evil Eye to be destroyed. It is best to deploy the Evil Eye on unbreakable walls or floors.
  - The Evil Eye is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
    - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
    - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
      - When disabled, the Evil Eye's turret will also be forcibly locked halfway open, allowing an Attacker to destroy it
    - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
    - Destroyed if the Twitch's Shock Drone hits the laser emitter when the Evil Eye's turret is open
- The Evil Eyes' metal shell is immune to gunfire and melee attacks.
  - The Evil Eyes can be destroyed by explosive damage, as well as Sledge's Breaching Hammer and flames from Maverick's Breaching Torch (both which behave as if they deal explosive damage).
- The Evil Eyes' glass panel is immune to gunfire, but can be shattered by melee attacks.
  - Once shattered, the Evil Eye is rendered blind in its closed state. However, its sound feed will remain unaffected.
  - To regain vision, Maestro has to open the Evil Eye's glass panel, revealing its weak point in the process.
  - A shattered Evil Eye cannot be picked up and relocated by Maestro.
- The Evil Eyes functions both as a camera and a turret.
  - The camera has a large range of motion, like Valkyrie's Black Eyes. On the ground the Evil Eye can swivel much farther than on walls. The Evil Eye can only reach 180 degrees on walls but no more than that. However, on the ground the Evil Eye can reach a full 360 degrees. Evil Eyes' cameras can see through smoke.
  - Both Maestro and his teammates can use the turret's camera controls, but Maestro has priority over controlling it.
- As a turret, Maestro can activate the Evil Eye's laser by Aiming Down Sight while on one.
  - Opening and closing the Evil Eye takes one second, during which the Evil Eye is unable to fire.
  - The Evil Eyes' laser deals 5 damage per shot, shooting at a rate of 4 shots per second.
  - The lasers can destroy Attacker drones, Claymores, Hard Breach Charges, Breach Charges. The lasers cannot destroy projectiles (i.e. Stun Grenades, Smoke Grenades, etc). The lasers also destroy Thermite's Exothermic Charge, Hibana's X-KAIROS Pellets, and Ace's SELMAs.
  - An Evil Eye can fire a maximum of 21 shots consecutively before overheating. This is tracked by a bar displayed on screen.
    - When not firing, the bar will recover 20% per second, therefore a maximum of 6 seconds is needed to fully recover an Evil Eye.
    - When overheated, the turret will automatically close and become disabled for 6 seconds while the Evil Eye cools.
  - While the Evil Eye's turret is open and ready to fire, it exposes its internal laser emitter. The laser emitter is not bulletproof; if it is hit by bullets, melee attacks, or Twitch's Shock Drones, the Evil Eye is destroyed.
  - Only Maestro can use the laser turret.

### Strategies/Synergies

- An Evil Eye will do 105 damage if all 21 shots land on an Operator before overheating which usually will land a kill on planting Attacker in late round.
- In the shattered state, Maestro can regain some vision without fully revealing the Evil Eye's weak point by tapping the aim button constantly.
- Turning turret directly up right before Thatcher throw of EMP will make it almost impossible to destroy turret.

### Counters

- Hitting the Evil Eye's glass panel with a melee strike will render it blind in the closed state.
- While an electronic gadget, the Evil Eyes interact somewhat differently to anti-electronic gadgets.
- Frag Grenades can destroy Evil Eyes within its explosive radius.
- IQ's Electronics Detector can detect Maestro's Evil Eyes.
- Twitch's Drone can destroy Maestro's Evil Eye cameras by shooting at them when they are open.
- Operators such as Ash, Fuze and Zofia can destroy them with their unique explosive gadgets.
- Sledge is able to take out an Evil Eye in one swing of his Breaching Hammer.
- Maverick can destroy an Evil Eye by burning it with his Breaching Torch.
- Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb can disrupt Maestro from using his Evil Eyes. Hacking into phones will also grant her and the Attackers access to the view on the Evil Eyes (though they can't rotate it or use its laser turret).
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy an Evil Eye if it is unlocked and in firing mode.
- Kali's LV Lances can destroy Evil Eyes.
- Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones can destroy Evil Eyes.
- Nøkk's HEL will remove her image from Maestro's Evil Eye cameras.
- Ash's Breaching Round or Kali's Explosive Lance can shatter the bulletproof glass when exploding if they hit on the glass.
