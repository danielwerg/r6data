# Dokkaebi

## Gameplay Description

Dokkaebi comes equipped with her Ballistic Armor Military Laptop, Logic Bomb. This device can upload a virus into the Defenders' phones and cause them to buzz incessantly for 12 seconds or until they reset it manually. If a Defender is killed and Dokkaebi is with the Attackers, she can hack their phones to gain access to their camera feeds.

- Activating Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb will cause all Defenders' phones to emit a noticeable buzzing sound, revealing their positions.
  - Activating the ability forces Dokkaebi into a 4 second animation, during which she cannot move or shoot.
  - Defenders cannot access their Cameras while the Logic Bomb is in effect (including dead ones).
- Defenders within the effective range of Mute's Signal Disruptor are not affected by the Logic Bomb when it activates or after it has activated.
- The effects of the Logic Bomb persist on a Defender until:
  - The effects have lasted for 12 seconds.
  - The Defender interacts with their phones to turn them off, playing a 5 second animation during which they cannot move or shoot
    - IQ can detect the Defenders' phones with her Electronics Detector when the Defenders are trying to turn them off.
  - The Defender moves into the effective range of a Mute's Signal Disruptor.
- The Logic Bomb has a cooldown of 10 seconds between activations.
- Defenders will drop phones upon death. Dokkaebi can hack these phones by interacting with them, giving all Attackers access to all Defender cameras. This process takes 6 seconds.
  - These include the CCTV, Bulletproof Cameras, Valkyrie's Black Eyes, Echo's Yokai, Maestro's Evil Eye, and Attacker drones hacked by Mozzie.
  - Dokkaebi only needs to perform this action once. Further hacks yields no additional access.
  - Dokkaebi can see dropped defender phones through walls.
  - IQ can detect dropped phones with her Electronics Detector.
  - The dropped phones are destroyable by any source of damage.
  - Hacking a Defender's phone is separate from the Logic Bomb.
  - Attackers do not gain control over Defender gadgets controlled through the camera menu, namely Echo's Yokai, Maestro's Evil Eyes, and drones hacked by Mozzie.
    - Their controls all remain exclusive to their owners.
    - Attackers will be able to view the camera even if the gadget moves.
- Defenders can now destroy their camera gadgets without incurring penalties.

### Strategies/Synergies

- IQ is able to detect phones through walls while defenders are trying to turn them off.
- Jackal can aid in tracking down Defenders, isolating them to get to their phones.
- Using the Logic Bomb alongside Lion's EE-ONE-D can force the Defenders into a difficult position where they cannot move or stay still. However, it is not recommended to use these gadgets at the same time.
- Dokkaebi can assist Blitz, forcing Defenders to act prematurely while Blitz will be able to know where the Defender is, flash them, and kill them.

### Counters

- Dokkaebi is vulnerable to enemy fire whilst she is using her Logic Bomb, meaning if she dies before her hacking is completed, it will be prevented.
- Defenders can manually destroy dropped phones to prevent Dokkaebi from hacking into them.
- Mute's Signal Disruptor can effectively counter Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb by making defenders immune to its effects.
- Vigil is not immune to the initial hacking of his phone, but he's able to remove himself from any hacked camera feed with his ERC-7. This includes being removed from hacked enemy gadgets.
