# Hibana

## Gameplay Description

Hibana's unique gadget is the X-KAIROS Launcher, which can fire explosive pellets that can be remotely detonated simultaneously and can pierce reinforced walls.

- Hibana is equipped with the X-KAIROS, a projectile launcher that fires thermal breaching pellets. The launcher has a total of 18 shots.
- The X-KAIROS initiates a box-reticle that is visible to everyone, showing where her pellets will land. The X-KAIROS Launcher has the ability to switch between the number of pellets it will fire.
  - The least amount of pellets the X-KAIROS Launcher can fire at a time are 2 pellets, which land on a surface as a 2x1 rectangle.
  - The X-KAIROS Launcher is able to fire 4 pellets, which land on a surface as a 2x2 square.
  - The greatest amount of pellets the X-KAIROS Launcher can fire at a time are 6 pellets, which land on a surface as a 2x3 rectangle.
  - The pellets only deploy on flat surfaces. They will not deploy on environmental props, player entities (including Terrorists), and some gadgets like Deployable Shields. When the pellets hit these objects, they will bounce away and deactivate.
  - The pellets do not disperse; even if aimed from an angle or at a distance, the pellets will deploy squarely on the surface Hibana fired at.
  - If the pellets hit an Operator directly, each pellet will deal 1 damage.
- Deployed X-KAIROS pellets can be destroyed by gunfire, melee, and explosive damage.
- If the player uses the gadget key again while X-KAIROS is active and some pellets were deployed, Hibana will trigger all deployed X-KAIROS pellets for detonation. After a short 5 second "melt time", the deployed X-KAIROS pellets will detonate. Each pellet can destroy a small section of a surface, and can destroy Reinforcements due to having thermal breaching properties.
  - A single pellet can destroy one of Mira's Black Mirrors.
  - A total of 4 pellets, regardless of placement, is required to open a hatch. Any less and small holes will be created instead.
  - Because the X-KAIROS only triggers the deployed pellets, Hibana has the option of deploying and activating a cluster of the X-KAIROS pellets one at a time, or deploying them all before activating them at once.
  - The time to melt through the metal is slightly longer than Thermite's Exothermic Charge, at 5 seconds compared to Thermite's 3.
  - X-KAIROS pellet explosions deal minimal damage, around 4 points each, and have a very small explosive radius. Because of these properties, Operators can drop from a reinforced hatch using the pellets without much self-inflicted harm.
  - JÃ¤ger and Wamai will not destroy or intercept X-KAIROS pellets.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Operators that handle electronic gadgets, like Thatcher, Twitch, IQ, Kali, Zero, and Flores, provide a near guarantee that the X-KAIROS pellets work as intended.
- Thermite provides a straight-up opening against Reinforced Walls. Alongside her mentor, the two can destroy many walls and hatches, reinforced or not.
- Maverick can provide immediate sight lines in a Reinforced Wall, especially when needed to destroy any Signal Disruptors or Shock Wires that prevent it.

### Counters

- Mute's Signal Disruptors will prevent the X-KAIROS pellets in its radius from beginning their detonation sequence.
- Like Thermite's Exothermic Charges, Bandit's Shock Wire can destroy the X-KAIROS pellets regardless whether they have already been triggered or not.
- Kaid's Electroclaw functions like Bandit's Shock Wires and will also destroy the X-KAIROS pellets.
- Maestro's Evil Eye can destroy with its laser.
- Hibana's X-KAIROS pellets can be destroyed by Impact Grenades.
