# Blitz

## Gameplay Description

Blitz's unique gadget is the G52-Tactical Shield, a Ballistic Shield loaded with forward-facing flash charges that Blitz can manually detonate, blinding anyone within the Shield's range.

- Blitz will absorb 66% of damage dealt from any source of explosive damage. This applies to all operators standing behind the shield.
- Blitz's Flash Shield has 4 charges. When his Shield equipped, Blitz can activate the shield's Flash Charges, blinding anyone in front of him.
  - The Flash Charges can be activated even when aiming down sights or sprinting.
  - The Flash Charges have a maximum reach of 7 meters, with full temporary blindness being caused at distances up to 4 meters.
    - At 7 meters a Flash Charge will cause minimal vision impairment.
  - Facing away from Blitz will not reduce the effects of the flash.
  - There is a 7 second cooldown between flashes.
- Blitz's sprint speed with his shield equipped is equivalent to a regular Heavy Armored Operator's sprint speed. When unequipped, Blitz moves like a regular Medium Armored Operator instead.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Turning right about 90 degrees while getting melee, being affected by explosives or Ela's Grzmot Mine will give Blitz most protection.

### Counters

- Getting meleed, hit by Echo's Yokai drone or by Ela's Grzmot Mines will expose most of Blitz's body.
- Smoke's Remote Gas Grenades will circumvent Blitz's defenses, like other Shield Operators.
- Lesion's Gu Mines will prevent Blitz from sprint and force him to put away his shield if he wishes to take out the needle.
- When activated, Warden's Glance Smart Glasses make him immune to the effects of the Flash Shield. Even after being flashed, by activating his ability, the Smart Glasses quickly clear up the flash effect and allow him to see normally.
- Oryx's Remah Dash can knock Blitz down like everyone else, leaving him vulnerable to damage until he gets back up.
- Blitz cannot activate his Flash Shield when he is standing within the effective range of Mute's Signal Disruptors.
- Clash's CCE Shield and Melusi's Banshees can slow Blitz down further.
- Solis' SPEC-IO Electro Sensor can detect blitz shield at any time.
