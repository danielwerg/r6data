# Melusi

## Gameplay Description

Melusi's Unique Gadget is the Banshee Sonic Defense device. When deployed on a wall or floor, the Banshee will emit a low buzzing noise whenever an Attacker enters its radius and line of sight. As well as alerting Defenders with its noise, the Banshee also slows down the movement of any Attacker within its radius, giving Melusi and other Defenders a prime chance to attack.

- The Banshee operates corresponding with the certain Operator's speed type: Fast, Medium, and Slow.
  - The Banshee's effect grows stronger the closer an Attacker is to the device
    - Starting at 4 meters the Banshee will begin to emit a low noise and reduce overall Operator's speed by 25%.
    - Starting at 2 meters the Banshee continues to emit a low noise and approaching it at this range will reduce the Operator's speed by 50%
- While inactive, the Banshee is bulletproof and can only be destroyed by explosives.
- The Banshee will only affect Operators' movement speed, but not their turning speed.
- When active, the Banshee will open and reveal its core where both the noise and slowing effect originate.
  - Shooting at the Banshee's unprotected core will instantly destroy it.
  - It takes a full 2 seconds for the Banshee to open the panels, revealing the core.
- The Banshee must have sight on any part of the Attacker in order to activate.
  - An Operator can still be affected even when prone.
  - This also applies to Drone holes and even small chunks of soft walls that have been destroyed.
- Under the effects of a Banshee, an Attacker will experience minimal distorted vision around the edge of their view, indicating they're under the effect.
- The Banshee will only affect Attackers.
  - This does not apply to utility or any other kind of device.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Stacking multiple gadgets designed to slow down opponents will be helpful, such as Barbed Wire or Clash's CCE Shield Tasers.
- The Banshee works well with gadgets such as Smoke's Gas Grenades and Goyo's Volcan Shields, preventing Attackers from getting away from these trap's effects quickly.
- When paired with Kaid's Electro Claw and Bandit's Shock Wires (when the latter are applied to Barbed Wire) the Banshee can become a devastating force.
- Mira can benefit Melusi if a Banshee is set down with direct sight (and it's radius reaches far enough) as it will affect Attacker coming anywhere near the open Black Mirror and beyond. The Banshee will not effect Attackers through a closed Black Mirror.

### Counters

- Briefly entering the Banshee's area of effect will make it vulnerable to gunfire. A teammate can destroy an active Banshee from afar if the affected Attacker is occupied.
- The Banshee can be destroyed by explosive devices, Ash's Breaching Rounds, Zofia's Impact Grenades, Fuze's Cluster Charges, Frag Grenades, Kali's LV Lances and Flores' RCE-RATERO Drone.
- Maverick can destroy the Banshees with his Breaching Torch, if he gets close enough.
- Thatcher can deactivate the Banshee with his EMP Grenades for 15 seconds, a follow-up gun fire or melee strike will destroy it.
- Impact EMP Grenades will do the same trick as Thatcher's EMP but for 9 seconds.
- Twitch can destroy the Banshee with her Shock Drone by shooting at them when they are open.
- Finka's Adrenal Surge can allow Attackers to move in the Banshee's radius without feeling its effects. However the Banshee will still emit a low noise until the Attacker is out of sight.
