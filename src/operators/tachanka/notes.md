# Tachanka

## Gameplay Description

Tachanka comes equipped with the RP-46 Degtyaryov LMG can now be selected as a primary weapon.

His Unique Gadget is the Shumikha Launcher. An antique grenade launcher that launches incendiary grenades which explode 0.75 seconds after the first bounce, leaving behind a wall of fire that can damage Attackers and block off entranceways. The grenades can be bounced off any surface, allowing the player to perform trick shots or strike targets without direct line of sight. Each grenade burns for 7 seconds each, Tachanka gets 14 of these with a maximum of 7 full rounds and then he must reload. The Shumikha Launcher grenades function similar to Capitão's Asphyxiating Bolts or Goyo's Volcán Shields, respectively the fire effect. There is a mild arc to each grenade's flight trajectory. In order to reach farther distances it will be necessary to aim further upwards.

- The destruction of LMG is as follows:
  - 0 - 4.99m: 0.3m radius hole
  - 5 - 7.99m: 0.2m radius hole
  - 8+m: 0.2m radius hole after three shots
    - This allows Tachanka to quickly open up rotation holes in walls. The RP-46 can also destroy hatches in 5 or less effective shots.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Tachanka works well with intel gathering Defenders such as Valkyrie and Echo. They can ping targets using their respetive cameras, allowing Tachanka to more accurately strike with his Shumikha grenades.
- Smoke and Goyo can help maximize effective area denial.
- Melusi can aid Tachanka by providing an oppressive gadget (her Banshees) that will slow down Attackers caught in the fire.
- When paired with Maestro and his LMG, they can provide large suppressive fire. The two of them anchoring an objective makes a powerful duo.
- Montagne is impervious to bullets coming from the front, and this includes Tachanka's LMG. though his Shumikha launcher can hit his shield and light the ground around Montagne, that paired with Montagne's slow speed makes the Shumikha launcher a good counter to Montagne. This also works with Blitz's Flash Shield, as it will force Blitz to fall back instead of rushing forward.
