# Kali

## Gameplay Description

Kali is equipped with the CSRX 300 rifle, a powerful bolt-action sniper rifle which can pierce through multiple breakable walls, and destroy wooden barricades within a single shot. It can down an enemy with one shot (unless they are 3 health with Rook's armor) to the chest or can kill them instantly with a headshot. The CSRX 300 comes equipped with interchangeable sights that are labeled 5x and 12x in-game.

The rifle is also equipped with an under-barrel launcher that fires LV Explosive Lances. These burrow into walls, even indestructible walls, pushing an explosive charge through the wall to the other side, and create an explosion on both sides of the wall. The explosion causes minimal damage to Defenders but will destroy any gadgets in the vicinity, making it useful for lowering defenses.

- The underbarrel launcher holds one LV Lance at a time. A new one is loaded after Kali fires an LV Lance.
- When fired at a wall, the LV Lance will burrow itself into the wall, and push an explosive charge to the other side.
  - The burrowing process takes 3 seconds to complete.
  - The LV Lances have a projectile size, unlike Ash's Breaching Rounds.
  - The LV Lances do not have a projectile arc, meaning they can travel in a straight line forever.
  - When burrowing, the Lance will create small particle effects showing the surface being drilled through, and produce cracks on the surface surrounding it.
  - When burrowing, explosive Lances can be destroyed with gunfire. In the case of a reinforced wall, the Lance can only be damaged at its tail-end base, not its burrowing tip.
  - It is able to burrow into unbreachable surfaces (will not explode on the other side of the wall), and will still detonate if it bounces off a surface it cannot burrow into.
  - The LV Lance is electric-proof and will not be destroyed by reinforced walls or barbed wires charged by Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.
- After the burrowing is complete, the LV Lance explodes, creating an explosion on both sides of the wall it burrowed through.
  - The explosive on both sides are equal in size, being 3 meters in radius.
  - The explosive damage drops off as distance increases, and gadgets like Frost's Welcome Mats will survive the explosion if they are further away from the Lance.
  - If burrowed on a destructible wall, the LV Lance leaves behind a small hole on the wall from the explosion. However, if it burrows through a Reinforced Wall the hole it would leave behind appears be sealed back up and cannot be shot through on both sides.
  - LV Lances will destroy friendly gadgets.
  - LV Lances can also be destroyed by Impact Grenades or Nitro Cells.
  - Mira's Black Mirrors cannot be destroyed by LV Lances.
  - Clash's CCE Shield can be knocked aside by LV Lances, but not destroyed.
- Explosive Lance can shatter Black Mirror if a projectile drills into it and explodes from the inside.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Kali works best with Operators such as Thermite, Ace, and Hibana whose gadgets are specialized in opening up holes in Reinforced Walls. Kali is capable of destroying gadgets on the other side with ease, allowing Thermite or Hibana to use their gadgets without getting them destroyed.

### Counters

- LV Lances can be intercepted by both JÃ¤ger's Active Defense Systems and Wamai's Mag-NETs.
- Rook's Armor Plates will make Kali's primary weapon less effective as any 1 speed/3 health Operator wearing Armor Plates will require a minimum of 2 shots to down/kill.
