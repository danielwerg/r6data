# Doc

## Gameplay Description

Doc's Unique Gadget is the MPD-0 Stim Pistol. It is able to revive and heal allies from afar.

- The Stim Pistol heals 200 health to any Operator that Doc hits with it, including Attackers.
  - A Stim Pistol can Overheal a player 20 health over their health capacity, granting an additional temporary health buffer, which decays at a rate of 1 health per second.
  - If Doc heals an attacker that is being affected by Lesion's Gu Mines, the Gu Needle will be removed from the attacker.
- The Stim Pistol can revive any downed Operators from afar with a single shot.
  - If used to revive an Operator, it will revive them to their maximum health and 20 extra health Overheal, compared to a manual revive's 20.
  - The revive process for the Stim Pistol is also shorter than a standard revive, taking only 2.75 seconds, compared to the regular revive time of 4 seconds.
- When in hand, the action button allows Doc to use the Pistol on himself, healing himself or even reviving himself if downed.
  - Pressing the action button again does not holster the Stim Pistol back to whatever gun Doc had switched out with. Meaning, he has to switch with the other action button to avoid accidentally using the Stim Pistol on himself.
- Unlike other guns, the Stim Pistol's shots have a short travel time, though they do not have projectile drop.
- The Stim Pistol shots can travel through bullet holes in walls.
  - The Stim Pistol also has pinpoint hip fire accuracy, thus not requiring to aim down sight to make accurate hits.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Doc works especially well with fellow GIGN defending Operator Rook and his Armor Plates, which grants those who wear the Plates heightened defenses and a greater chance of being downed than killed.
