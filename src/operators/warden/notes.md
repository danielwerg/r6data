# Warden

## Gameplay Description

Warden's unique gadget is a pair of Glance Smart Glasses, special glasses that nullify the effects of Stun Grenades, Smoke Grenades, and other related gadgets.

- The Smart Glasses have an infinite number of uses and run on a charge.
  - The effects of the Smart Glasses last for a maximum of 20 seconds.
  - The Smart Glasses take 9 seconds to completely recharge.
  - If the Smart Glasses run out of charge or are manually deactivated, they may only be reactivated once the recharge bar reaches 20% or higher.
- Once activated, Warden attains the following properties:
  - Immunity to blinding effects caused by Stun Grenades, Blitz's Flash Shield, or Ying's Candelas.
  - If affected by any flash effects, turning the Smart Glasses on will remove the effects. This does not prevent audio impairments.
  - The ability to see through smoke.
    - The vision through smoke fades while Warden is moving, and the faster Warden moves, the quicker the smoke vision fades.
      - The curved bars on both sides of the player's screen indicate Warden's degree of visibility through smokes.
      - While sprinting, visibility through smokes decreases at 50% per second.
      - While walking, visibility through smokes decreases at 40% per second.
      - While crouch walking, visibility through smokes decreases at 33% per second.
      - While slow walking, visibility through smokes decreases at 20% per second.
      - While standing still, visibility through smokes will completely recharge in one second.
  - Warden's watch becomes detectable by IQ's Electronics Detector.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Using Warden's glasses, he can see through the yellow smoke clouds released by Smoke's Remote Gas Grenades. In some scenarios, combining Warden and Smoke's gadgets can potentially catch enemies off-guard.

### Counters

- Warden's glasses can be disabled for 15 seconds by Thatcher using his EMP grenades.
- Using the Electronics Detector, IQ can spot and potentially take out Warden through surfaces when Warden's glasses are active.
- Glaz's Flip Sight also possesses the ability to see through smoke clouds, making him a viable choice at combating Warden.
  - Whilst warden can see through smoke as well, having to slow done to do so makes him an easier to hit.
