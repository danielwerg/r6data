# Tubarão

## Gameplay Description

Tubarão's Unique Gadget is the Zoto Canister, a throwable device that detonates on impact, creating a temporary frozen area which deactivates any electronic or mechanical gadgets in its radius for 12 seconds, as well as slowing down and leaving the footprints of any Attacker that walks into it.

- Electrical insulation effect remains for 1.5 seconds after Canister destruction. 

### Strategies/Synergies

- The frozen AOE of the Zoto Canister will also disable Defender gadgets.
- Gadgets that can collect intel remotely, such as Pulse's Heartbeat Sensor, Valkyrie's Black Eyes, Solis's SPEC-IO Electro-Sensor and Maestro can help Tubarão track Attackers through walls and communicate when a Hard Breacher will try and open a surface or when they're above them in order for him to deploy the Zoto.
- Tubarão's gadget also goes well with other gadget-denial Defenders, such as Bandit, Kaid and Mute, as they can coordinate their wall-denial for optimal timing. The Zoto gives these operators more breathing room and time to perfectly execute their tricking strategies.
- Because of it's slowing capabilities, the Zoto also works well when combined with trap operators, such as Kapkan, Thorn, Fenrir and others. Note: if the trap in question is hit by the Zoto's radius, it will also be deactivated, so placement is key.

### Counters

- While Tubarão counters most gadgets due to his Zoto Canister's extremely low temperatures affecting electronics and freezing mechanical joints, well timed explosions from Frag Grenades, Zofia's KS-79 Lifeline and other similar devices will destroy the canister.
- Maverick's Tactical Breaching Torch will melt through the ice of Tubarão's gadget, making him a direct counter to the Defender's influence.
