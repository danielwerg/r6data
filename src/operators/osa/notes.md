# Osa

## Gameplay Description

Osa's Unique Gadget is the Talon-8 Clear Shield, a rectangular shield made of bulletproof, transparent material. Osa can carry a shield to defend herself, or can deploy the shield on floors, doorways, and windows, providing defense for Attackers while maintaining line of sight on Defenders.

- Osa carries Talon-8 Shield which protects her from the front, and can deploy them on the ground.
  - The Talon Shields however have opening on the bottom while carried. Even crouching cannot close this gap.
  - Osa cannot run or go prone with the Talon Shield. Doing such actions will put the shield away.
  - Osa cannot use weapons or melee while carrying the Talon Shield.
- While rappelling, Osa can switch to her Talon Shield.
  - Osa cannot initiate a rappel, or climb up the grapple's end, while holding the Shield.
  - While rappelling upright, Osa holds the shield horizontally rotated.
  - While rappelling upside down, Osa holds the shield in the normal position.
  - Osa can deploy Talon Shields on windows while rappelling, upright or upside down.
  - When rappelling in, the carry stance will change back from horizontal to vertical.
- Osa can't vault while holding her shield.
- When placed, Talon Shields will instantly destroy any Barricades in place, regardless of the number of hit required.
  - Around halfway through the deployment sequence, the barricade is destroyed. At that point Osa can cancel the deployment sequence and return to carry the shield.
- Talon Shields will crack when taking fire, both when deployed and when being held out before placement.
- Talon Shields can be picked up at any time, but the damage to the shield will remain.
- Talon Shields are not tall enough to cover the entirety of a doorway or windows, and would leave a space open to fire or move through.
  - If Osa is rappelling upside down, the Shield's positioning will also be upside down, with the canister at the top and the opening at the bottom.
- The Talon Shield is deployed slightly forward from the holding position, before extending its wing diagonally backward.
  - On doors, a placement of Talon Shield exposes Osa diagonally.
    - Once deployed however, the shield will fit the door frame
- Deployed Talon Shields have a small pressurized canister at their base on the deployer's side.
  - If it is broken, the entire shield will be destroyed.
- Since it's bulletproof glass, Osa's Talon Shields vision can be blocked by a melee strike on the shield's surface.
  - If the Shield is rendered opaque, Osa cannot pick it back up.
- While deploying the Talon Shield, Osa will be repositioned slightly
  - On doors and windows, Osa will be repositioned to face directly into them
  - For small doors and windows, Osa will be positioned to its center.
  - Osa's side is exposed while deploying.
  - For wide door and window frames, Osa will be positioned to one of the sides, depending which is closer.
  - For any door frame size, Osa's shield is not directly within the window frame, but slightly beyond.
  - Osa cannot deploy both Talon Shields too close to each other.
- Attackers may rappel into windows even with Talon Shield deployed on it. This destroys the Talon Shield.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Talon Shields could be used to quickly open barricades.
- Talon Shields could be used to disabled Aruni's Surya Laser Gates.
- While Osa carries the Talon Shield, she takes reduced damage from explosives. Potentially even surviving a close-range Nitro Cell is positioned correctly.

### Counters

- Castle's Armor Panels, and barricades armed with Goyo's Volcán Canisters, will block Osa's Talon Shields from deploying on doors or window.
- Talon Shields are easily destroyed by explosives, such as Nitro Cells and Impact Grenades.
  - This also includes friendly gadgets, such as Frag Grenades.
- A melee attack will shatter Talon Shields, preventing both Defenders and Attackers from seeing through them.
- Oryx is able to Remah Dash directly through the shield and knock back any attackers on the other side, subsequently destroying the shield.
- Fire (Tachanka's Shumikha Grenade and Goyo's Volcán Canisters) and Smoke's Gas Grenade can force attackers away from the Talon Shield's protection
- While the Talon Shield is being carried, a melee strike will not render the shield's glass opaque, nor will explosives destroy it. Instead, the shield will sway away from Osa's front to the right and exposing her to attacks.
  - Osa also sway in a similar manner if she is shocked by Clash's CCE Shield.
