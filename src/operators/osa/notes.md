# Osa

## Gameplay Description

Osa's Unique Gadget is the Talon-8 Clear Shield, a rectangular shield made of bulletproof, transparent material. Osa can carry a shield to defend herself, or can deploy the shield on floors, doorways, and windows, providing defense for Attackers while maintaining line of sight on Defenders.

- Osa carries Talon-8 Shield which protects her from the front, and can deploy them on the ground.
  - The Talon Shields however have opening on the bottom while carried. Even crouching cannot close this gap.
  - Osa cannot run or go prone with the Talon Shield. Doing such actions will put the shield away.
  - Osa cannot use weapons or melee while carrying the Talon Shield.
- Deployed Talon Shields have a small pressurized canister at their base on the deployer's side.
  - If it is broken, the entire shield will be destroyed.
- While rappeling, Osa can switch to her Talon Shield.
  - Osa cannot initiate a rappel, or climb up the grapple's end, while holding the Shield.
  - While rappeling upright, Osa holds the shield horizontally rotated.
  - While rappeling upside down, Osa holds the shield in the normal position.
  - Osa can deploy Talon Shields on windows while rappelling, upright or upside down.
  - When rappeling in, the carry stance will change back from horizontal to vertical.
- Osa can't vault while holding her shield.
- When placed, Talon Shields will instantly destroy any Barricades in place, regardless of the number of hit required.
  - Around halfway through the deployment sequence, the barricade is destroyed. At that point Osa can cancel the deployment sequence and return to carry the shield.
- Talon Shields will crack when taking fire, both when deployed and when being held out before placement.
- Talon Shields can be picked up at any time, but the damage to the shield will remain.
- Talon Shields are not tall enough to cover the entirety of a doorway or windows, and would leave a space open to fire or move through.
  - If Osa is rappeling upside down, the Shield's positioning will also be upside down, with the canister at the top and the opening at the bottom.
- Since it's bulletproof glass, Osa's Talon Shields vision can be blocked by a melee strike on the shield's surface.
  - If the Shield is rendered opaque, Osa cannot pick it back up.
- While deploying the Talon Shield, Osa will be repositioned slightly.
  - On doors and windows, Osa will be repositioned to face directly into them, and to its middle.
  - Osa cannot deploy both Talon Shields too close to each other.
- Attackers may rappel into windows even with Talon Shield deployed on it. This destroys the Talon Shield.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Talon Shields could be used to quicly open barricades.
- Talon Shields could be used to disabled Aruni's Surya Laser Gates.

### Counters

- Castle's Armor Panels, and barricades armed with Goyo's Volcán Canisters, will block Osa's Talon Shields from deploying on doors or window.
- Talon Shields are easily destroyed by explosives, such as Nitro Cells and Impact Grenades.
  - This also includes friendly gadgets, such as Frag Grenades.
- A melee attack will shatter Talon Shields, preventing both Defenders and Attackers from seeing through them.
- Fire (Tachanka's Shumika Grenade and Goyo's Volcán Canisters) and Smoke's Gas Grenade can force attackers away from the Talon Shield's protection
- While the Talon Shield is being carried, a melee strike will not render the shield's glass opaque, nor will explosives destroy it. Instead, the shield will sway away from Osa's front to the right and exposing her to attacks.
  - Osa also sway in a similar manner if she is shocked by Clash's CCE Shield.
