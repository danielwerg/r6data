# Goyo

## Gameplay Description

Goyo's unique gadget is the Volcán Canister. The canister explodes when fired upon, leaving a large carpet of flames as an area of denial for players who try to cross it.

- Goyo has four Volcán Canisters. He can deploy them on all reachable surfaces including walls, floors, hatches, as well as several types of furniture.
  - Canisters take approximately 4 seconds to deploy.
  - Canisters cannot be placed on Deployable Shields.
- The Volcán Canister will detonate if its red explosive canister is hit by gunfire, explosives, or melee attacks. The rest of the canister is bulletproof but is still susceptible to explosives.
- If Canister's are placed close enough together and one detonates, a chain reaction will occur and detonate all Canisters within the firsts area of effect.
- The fire is 4.05m in diameter.
- The fire deals 12 points of damage per tick and inflicts three ticks of damage per second (36 DPS). It lasts 20 seconds before dissipating. Neither the explosion nor the fire damage any gadgets, friendly or not.
- When detonated, the canister creates a small explosive which will make a small hole if planted on a soft wall. It will not deal explosive damage or destroy friendly gadgets.
  - A large area of flames will spread on the side of the wall the canister was planted on while a smaller area of flames will spread through the hole on the other side of the wall. This allows for area denial in multiple rooms with a single canister.
- The Canister can be placed on Barricades. It will detonate if the barricade is destroyed.
  - If the Canister is placed on a window barricade above the window sill, its fire will spread on both sides of the window.
  - If the Canister is placed below the window sill on a window barricade, it will be almost impossible for Attackers to see it. This can prove to be effective against Attackers who vault through window barricades.
- If placed on floor hatches, detonation will destroy the hatch and cause fire to spread to the floor below. The fire will only spread.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Kapkan's Entry Denial Devices can be used to automatically provide an explosion that triggers the Canister.
- If an Evil Eye is set within the vicinity of a canister, Maestro can use them to detonate the Canister from a safe distance, without needing to expose himself.
- The Volcan Canister can be placed on Castle's Armor Panels and will detonate if breached.
- Melusi's Banshees can slow down Attackers caught in the flames.
- Aruni's Surya Gates can help maximize area denial on barricades and reinforced walls but will first enter a standby phase.
- Wamai can help Goyo maximize area denial by placing his MAG-NETS on the canisters to lure attacker projectiles and detonating them.
- Jäger's Active Defense Systems can protect the canisters from being triggered.
- Volcan Canisters can be placed to block Drone holes.

### Counters

- A poorly placed Volcán Canister can easily be used against the Defenders.
- Ash's Breaching Rounds and Zofia's Impact Grenades will trigger the explosion with their gadgets.
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers can trigger explosions if the canister is hit directly.
- Amaru can bypass a detonated canister when using her gadget to enter a window. She will land at the edge of the Canister's flames and will not take damage if she moves quick enough.
- Twitch can use her Shock Drones to trigger the explosives from a safe distance without needing to expose herself.
