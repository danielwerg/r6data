# Ash

## Gameplay Description

Ash comes equipped with the M120 CREM. It can shoot up to two Breaching Rounds, which will burrow into a surface and detonate automatically.

- Ash is equipped with a single-shot grenade launcher that can fire Breaching Rounds. When one Breaching Round is fired, Ash reloads the grenade launcher with her next Breaching Round.
  - Breaching Rounds are unaffected by gravity and do not drop off at any range, meaning they could travel forever.
  - Breaching Rounds have no projectile size; they can pass through openings that are as small as a bullet hole.
  - Breaching Rounds have a radius of 3 meters.
- After striking a surface, the Breaching Round will stick to the surface and explode after 2 seconds.
  - Breaching Rounds are unaffected by Mute's Signal Disruptors and electricity from Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.
  - The destruction from Breaching Rounds is slightly different from a standard Breach Charge, being narrower and taller.
- The explosion of the breaching round deals a maximum of 50 damage to Light Health Operators.
- Getting struck directly by a Breaching Round will result in dealing 50 damage, regardless of armor, though the charge will only bounce off and not detonate.
- If Mira has deployed a Black Mirror on an unreinforced wall, she can instantly destroy the Black Mirror (and the wall) by firing a breaching round on the Black Mirror itself.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Ash can fire her Breaching Rounds at surfaces that would normally be hard or impossible to reach for a Breach Charge, like higher windows or even ceilings.
- The Breaching Rounds can easily destroy Deployable Shields and can injure the Operator behind it.
- The explosion can destroy Barbed Wire very quickly.
- Certain destructible walls can't be completely covered by Reinforcements, and an uncovered destructible gap exists at the top of the wall. Ash can easily destroy the gaps with the Breaching Rounds, creating certain angles and allowing projectiles to go through.
- Breaching Round can shatter Black Mirror if a projectile drills into it and explodes from the inside.

### Counters

- JÃ¤ger's Active Defense System can intercept the Breaching Rounds if they're within their range.
- If caught in Wamai's Mag-NET it will pull in the breaching round and cause a smaller explosion around the Mag-NET.
