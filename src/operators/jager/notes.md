# J채ger

## Gameplay Description

J채ger's unique gadget is the ADS-MKIV "Magpie", which can intercept live grenades before they detonate.

- The ADS can be placed on either walls, floors, and other interactive surfaces.
  - The ADS is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
    - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
    - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
    - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
- Each ADS maintains a steady blue glow where it will intercept projectiles.
- Each ADS has an effective range of 5.5 meters.
- Each ADS can intercept up to one projectile before shutting off.
  - The ADS only intercepts projectiles that are in their detection range while also having a direct line of sight to them.
  - Multiple ADSs covering the same area will not be simultaneously triggered by the same projectile.
  - After an ADS shuts off, the ADS will remain in place, but will no longer catch projectiles until 10 seconds later.
  - An ADS will intercept projectiles as soon as they enter its line of sight.
    - The recharge rate is infinite, the only downside is having to recharge for 10 seconds.
      - Picking up and placing down any ADSs will reset the timer.
  - An Active Defense System can be destroyed by any kind of method, melees, explosives, gunfire, etc.
- The following attacker projectiles can be intercepted by the ADS:
  - Frag Grenades
  - Stun Grenades
  - Smoke Grenades
  - Impact EMP Grenades
  - Projectiles from the GONNE-6
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades
  - Ash's Breaching Rounds
  - The sub grenades from Fuze's Cluster Charges
  - Ying's Candela Grenades if it was thrown, as well as the individual Fla- Charges from it if detonated
  - Zofia's Impact Grenades and Concussion Grenades
  - Nomad's Airjabs
  - Gridlock's Trax Stingers
  - Kali's LV Lances
  - Ace's SELMAs
  - Zero's ARGUS Cams
  - Sens's ROU Projector System
  - Grim's Kawan Hives

### Strategies/Synergies

- Wamai can help maximize protection from similar devices that Active Defense Systems destroy. However, if a MAG-net catches a projectile and brings it into range of an ADS, the ADS will destroy the projectile, using up both gadgets.

### Counters

- As an electronic gadget, the Active Defense Systems are susceptible to the same weaknesses as other gadgets of its type.
  - Thatcher is able to disable the ADSs with his EMP Grenades for 15 seconds, as long as the grenades do not get intercepted first by the ADS.
  - Twitch can destroy the ADSs with her Shock Drone from a safe distance.
  - IQ can search and destroy Active Defense Systems with ease with her Electronics Detector.
  - Kali can use her LV Lance to take out the ADSs, as long as the Lance does not get intercepted first.
  - Zero can destroy the ADSs if not destroyed prior.
  - Flores can destroy up ADSs safely.
- In some cases, sacrificing a couple of projectiles such as Stun Grenades can be done to use up an Active Defense System, allowing for more important gadgets, like Frag Grenades, Zofia's Impact Grenades, or Ash's Breaching Rounds to activate unimpeded
- Capit찾o's Incendiary Bolts and Micro Smoke Grenades can't be caught by ADS.
- Later also applies to Hibana X-KAIROS pellets.
- Ying has the ability to place her Candela on a breachable surface releasing all 6 Flash Charges. This drains all three ADSs.
- Fuze's Cluster charges can waste J채ger's ADS total interceptions.
- Brava can hack the ADS with the use of the Kludge Drone converting it to the Attackers team.
