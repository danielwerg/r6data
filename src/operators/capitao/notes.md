# Capitão

## Gameplay Description

Capitão's unique gadget is a Tactical Crossbow that can fire Asphyxiating Bolts, which will burn oxygen within a certain radius, as well as Micro Smoke grenades, that can mask positions and team movements.

- Capitão's Tactical Crossbow features a Red Dot Sight unique to itself and is loaded with Asphyxiating Bolts by default. The user can switch to the alternate ammunition by pressing the firing mode key. Capitão will automatically load the alternate ammunition when one is depleted.
  - Capitão has two Asphyxiating Bolts and two Micro Smoke Grenades. Capitão reloads the Crossbow by racking its foregrip, meaning that reloading is much faster than switching ammunition types.
    - Each ammunition type is represented by different color containers. The Asphyxiating Bolts are a gray and orange, and are automatically set as the ammo being used first. The Micro Smoke grenades are a gray and blue, and can be switched to.
  - The Crossbow fires nearly silently.
  - Any ammunition fired from the crossbow isn't affected by gravity at ranges less than 10 meters. Past 10 meters, the trajectory slowly drops due to gravity.
  - Crossbow bolts have no projectile size; they can pass through openings that are as small as a bullet hole.
  - A direct impact from a bolt deals 5 damage, but it cannot cause a headshot.
- Asphyxiating Bolts creates a cloud of fire at the area of impact.
  - The fire has a maximum radius of 5 meters.
  - The Asphyxiating Bolts take 2 seconds to reach their maximum area of effect, spreading from a small cloud of fire to an inferno in two increments.
  - The spread of the fire is blocked by objects; hiding behind a Deployable Shield can minimize or even prevent damage from a fire in front of the shield.
  - The fire deals 12 damage per tick and inflicts three ticks of damage per second (overall DPS ≈ 36).
  - The fire lasts around 10 seconds before dissipating.
  - The fire always spreads at ground level. If an Asphyxiating Bolt hits the ceiling, it will drop down and spread fire after it hits the ground.
  - Despite visual appearances implying otherwise, the Asphyxiating Bolts damages only Operators and the Hostage, not any surrounding gadget caught in its area of effect.
- Micro Smoke Grenades create a smokescreen at the area of impact. They cover a much wider area than a regular Smoke Grenade being 5 meters in diameter and last 11 seconds, similar to regular smoke grenades.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Capitão can create cover for him or a teammate to plant the Defuser in the Bomb gamemode with his Micro Smoke Grenades.
- Capitão could utilize his Asphyxiating Bolts to reach places that are out of his sight by hitting nearby surfaces.

### Counters

- Wamai can use his Mag-NET System to catch and reposition both types of bolts. Although the bolts still provide their effect, being repositioned can render them useless or even detrimental to the attacking team.
- Warden can activate his Smart Glasses to see through the Micro Smoke Grenade clouds.
- Tachanka can use his Shumikha Launcher to cover the area of the Micro Smoke Grenade clouds with fire, preventing attackers from pushing through without taking high damage, or from planting in that area.
- Doc could survive inside of a fire as long as keeps on healing himself at the right time.
