# Maverick

## Gameplay Description

Maverick comes equipped with his Exothermic-S "Suri" Torch. It can make holes in any breachable surface, including Reinforced Walls, creating new lines of sight quietly.

- The Breaching Torch is a weapon-type gadget; Maverick needs to holster his weapons to bring up the Breaching Torch which leaves him vulnerable to any sort of damage.
- Firing the Breaching Torch produces a constant jet of flame with a maximum distance of two meters. The jet of flame destroys breakable surfaces and objects it touches and damages Operators and Hostages it touches.
  - The Breaching Torch can destroy reinforced surfaces.
  - To destroy reinforced surfaces, the flame must be sustained over the same section of the surface for a quarter of a second before the surface is actually breached.
    - Moving too quickly will not cut the reinforced surface properly while moving too slowly will waste fuel.
    - Aiming in with the Breaching Torch is suitable for cutting through reinforced walls as it applies good use of fuel with just enough time to cut through the surfaces.
  - The Breaching Torch can destroy reinforced hatches. However, the reinforced hatch must be destroyed up to a certain level by the breaching torch before it is destroyed (much longer than other breaching gadgets).
  - The Breaching Torch can cut into Castle's Armor Panels, and eventually destroy them with enough damage. Enough lines or holes created in the Armor Panels and they will be destroyed.
  - The Breaching Torch can destroy many bulletproof gadgets. Such as:
    - Destroying a Barbed Wire requires less than a second of focused Blowtorch fire.
    - Deployable Shields
    - Maestro's Evil Eyes
    - Goyo's Volcan Shields
    - Melusi's Banshees
  - The Torch deals 5 damage to an operator touching the flame every quarter of a second. (20 damage per second)
- Firing the Breaching Torch (regardless if the flame hits anything) consumes fuel. The Breaching Torch has six fuel tanks in total, each providing 5 seconds of flame.
  - Reloading the Breaching Torch takes roughly one second, however, any leftover fuel in the tank will be lost, even if the tank was mostly full.
- The Breaching Torch is not affected by Mute's Signal Disruptors, Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws, however, in the case of the latter two, getting too close to them will still shock Maverick.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Creating a hole that Maverick and other Operators can traverse through takes time and a lot of fuel. Circular holes maximize the area breached without wasting fuel. Keeping the hole close to the ground can allow crouching through them.
- Due to how destruction works, cutting a line through the top of a reinforced wall and another through the bottom of it will completely destroy the middle of the wall between the two lines. This is because the anchors on reinforced walls are broken. The lines made will have to reach the other side of the wall in order for the anchors to be broken. The wall itself will not be destroyed, but the wall will be un-reinforced. This leaves the now un-reinforced wall vulnerable to breaching methods.
- Bringing another Operator with Smoke Grenades can provide ample cover so that Maverick can create small circular holes to enter. This however is difficult to achieve and requires efficiency.
- The mechanic for breaking reinforced hatches is less understood. But it is certain that burning what is already broken does not contribute to destroying the hatch. Maverick needs to cut around the edges of the hatch to effectively destroy it.
- The Breaching Torch cannot breach through Mira's Black Mirrors by burning them directly. Instead, breaching the four anchors at their corners (only visible on the inside) will instantly destroy it.
- Alternatively, burning a hole underneath the Mira window exposes its gas canister, allowing an Attacker to shoot it and eject the Black Mirror.
- Due to his main role in creating holes in reinforced surfaces, Operators such as Blackbeard and Glaz can benefit the most from working with Maverick.
- IQ can find gadgets behind Reinforced Walls so that Maverick can make a precise hole in which to destroy the gadget.
- Maverick can benefit from Lion's EE-ONE-D Drone, which will discourage Defenders from moving, allowing Maverick to create holes in relative safety.
- If Maverick pairs up with Fuze, he can burn a reinforced wall at the side in a U-shape and allow Fuze to plant Cluster Charge at the remaining breakable wall portion. This is because both the top and bottom anchors of the Reinforcement are broken, meaning only the wall is intact.

### Counters

- Kaid's Electroclaws, unlike Bandit's Shock Wires, can affect many Reinforced Walls and Hatches that are within its range. When placed carefully, Maverick cannot directly destroy them himself.
  - While Bandit can also do so to a lesser extent, he's less effective at this because his Shock Wires are more predictable to find. He must also be near the wall to replace the destroyed Shock Wires, and thus exposed to the murder hole created during the process.
