# Recruit Attack

## Gameplay Description

The Recruit is the default Operator featured in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. The Recruit is available in all playlists except Ranked unless you know things.

Instead of preset loadouts varying by CTU, attacking and defending recruits can now select different weapons and equipment in a similar manner to Operators. Sights and attachments are all automatically equipped to each weapon, weapon skins and attachment skins also cannot be equipped.

Available to all, the Attack Recruit has a specific loadout with preset attachments but no unique gadget, designed to learn the basics of an attacking round.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The main strategy when it comes to Recruits is to intimidate the enemy with the fact you are able to play recruit.
- Recruit with stun grenades, frag grenades and super-shorty is arguable is a better sledge.

### Counters

- Ban Recruit
