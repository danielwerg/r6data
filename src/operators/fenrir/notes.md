# Fenrir

## Gameplay Description

Fenrir's Unique Gadget is The F-Natt Dread Mine, a throwable device that sticks to surfaces. While deactivated, the mine is bulletproof, and is activated on Fenrir's command. Once activated, the Dread mine will emit a fear gas cloud whenever an Attacker enters its radius. This gas obscures the vision of any Operator within the cloud, making it impossible to see anything in the distance, and leaving them very vulnerable to attack.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Gadgets that slow down Attackers, such as Clash's Electro Shield, Melusi's Banshee Device, and Lesion's Gu Mines, can help prevent Defenders from escaping the Dread Mine's smoke cloud.
- Camera gadgets such as Valkyrie's Black Eye, Maestro's Evil Eyes and Solis' Electro Scanner can help Fenrir keep track of when Attackers are close to a Dread Mine he can activate.
- Dread Mines can help obscure traps such as Thorn's Razorbloom Shells or Frost's Welcome Mat.
- Caveira can use the Dread Mine's smoke cloud to easily sneak up on an Attacker while using her Silent Step.

### Counters

- While in their bulletproof state, F-Natt Dread Mines can be destroyed by explosive devices such as Frag Grenades, Ash's Breaching Rounds, Zofia's Impact Grenades, Fuze's Cluster Charges, Kali's LV Lances and Flores' RCE-RATERO Drone.
- While they are activated, Dread Mines are vulnerable to gunfire and melee attacks.
- F-Natt Dread Mine is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
  - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
  - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
  - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
  - Destroyed by Twitch's Shock Drones (when activated)
  - Destroyed by Zero's ARGUS Cameras (when activated)
- When disabled by EMP the bulletproof housing opens which exposes the F-Natt to gunfire and melee.
- If Fenrir is caught in the radius of the EMP, he cannot activate any F-Natt Dread Mines until it wears off.
- Finka's Adrenal Surge can reduce effectiveness of the fear effect.
- Montagne can trigger Dread Mine and provide the cover for the rest of the team to come in and destroy the F-Natt that have been triggered.
- Brava's Kludge Drone can hack F-Natt if it's activated otherwise it will be destroyed.
- Sledge is able to take out a F-Natt Dread Mine in one swing of his Breaching Hammer.
