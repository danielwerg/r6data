## Gameplay Description

Additionally, the following devices will be destroyed after a short delay once hacked:

- Bandit's Shock Wires
- Kaid's Electroclaws

### Strategies/Synergies

- IQ, Zero, and Twitch can use their gadgets to locate Defender gadgets for Brava to hack.

### Counters

- Gadgets hacked by the Kludge drone will have a faint red and blue light surrounding them.
- Mozzie's Pests can take control of the Kludge Drone, allowing him to hack into Attacker gadgets and turn them against Attackers.
- Solis' Electro Scanner can locate and track the Kludge Drone.
- Mute's Signal Jammers can shut the Kludge drone down, but they can still be hacked if in the drone's line of sight. Additionally, Brava's second Kludge drone can save the first one if it gets jammed.
