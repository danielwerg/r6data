# Kapkan

## Gameplay Description

Kapkan comes equipped with his homemade EDD MKII Tripwires, special mines that can anchor on doorway and window frames, detonating when enemies trigger its laser.

- Kapkan spawns with 5 Entry Denial Devices that can be attached to the frame of any barricadable doorway or window.
  - All device can be deployed on the same frame.
  - The position of the deployed EDD corresponds to the position the player was aiming at when starting the deployment animation.
    - The lowest an EDD can be placed on windows is around chest-height.
    - The lowest placement on a doorway is varied between doorways, although it is usually between shin-height down to being at ankle-height.
    - In either case, the highest an EDD can be placed is head-height.
  - The EDD is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
    - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
    - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
    - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
    - Destroyed by Twitch's Shock Drones
- An EDD creates an invisible horizontal laser tripwire across the doorway it is placed on, shooting from the center of the EDD. An EDD will trigger and explode when an Attacker touches the tripwire.
- An EDD laser tripwire cannot cover more than its designated entry point.
- The damage of an EDD explosion is 60.
  - The explosion has an effective range of 3 meters before dropping off harshly.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Hiding an EDD on a doorway or window by using any environmental obstruction can be key in order for them to go unnoticed.
- Placing an EDD where enemies don't have a direct line of sight on them can trick them into thinking they're safe.

### Counters

- Since the EDD only explodes when its tripwire is triggered, Attackers's movements are key to avoid triggering the EDD.
  - If the EDD is mounted very low, an Attacker can avoid the tripwire by vaulting over a Deployable Shield or a broken barricade.
  - An EDD set too high can be avoided by simply moving while crouching or prone.
  - Be aware that when meleeing a barricaded window, if the Attacker's hand hits through into an EDD's laser the EDD can be triggered.
- Kapkan's EDDs are destructible and can be destroyed with a single gunshot.
- Operators with shields receive reduced damage if their shield is facing the explosion, thus allowing them to take minimal damage from the devices.
- IQ's Electronics Detector can detect Kapkan's Entry Denial Devices.
- Ash, due to the explosive and flexible nature of her Breaching Rounds, can destroy Barricades and Deployable Shields on doorways or windows, also removing any EDD device on the frame as she enters through it.
- Zofia to a lesser extent follows the same strategy, but may not destroy the EDD device on larger doorframes.
- Twitch's Shock Drone can destroy an EDD with its taser.
- Thatcher's can disable Entry Denial Gates with his EMP Grenades for a duration of 15 seconds.
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers will destroy an EDD with ease.
- Kali's LV Lances will destroy EDDs.
- Flores' RCE-RATERO Drone will also destroy EDDs.
- Brava's Kludge Drone will convert EDDs against Kapkan or other defenders, so defender should pay attention whether the EDDs is converted or not.
