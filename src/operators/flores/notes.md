# Flores

## Gameplay Description

Flores' Unique Gadget is the RCE-RATERO Drone, an explosive drone device which can be controlled remotely like a regular drone.

- Flores starts with one regular Drone in the Prep Phase and another during the Action Phase. Additionally, Flores has 4 of his RCE-RATERO Drones during the Action Phase.
- The RCE-RATERO can jump like a normal drone, with the same cooldown time between jumps (3 seconds).
- The RCE-RATERO is able to fit in drone holes and can jump onto environmental props when active.
- The RCE-RATERO's set timer is 10 seconds. After the timer reaches 0, the drone will automatically anchor itself to its position and detonate under the safety of the bulletproof armor.
- When the RCE-RATERO is deployed it will automatically begin moving forward once Flores has entered its feed. During its lifespan the drone will be unable to reverse or stop in place, no matter what.
- Pressing the gadget button once will trigger the RCE-RATERO drone into its bulletproof armor state, after which it will detonate within 3 seconds.
  - The drone, once prompted to detonate, will close a bulletproof shell around itself. This process is quick and nearly instantaneous.
  - Whenever the drone is set into its bulletproof armor stage, it will attach itself to the nearest wall or floor, and produce an explosion.
  - If Flores disengages manual control of the RCE-RATERO before it enters its bulletproof state, it will keep going forward in a straight line and enter the bulletproof state automatically once the timer runs out. It will also be impossible to regain control of the deployed RCE-RATERO once this action occurs.
  - The explosion will deal heavy damage to both allies and enemies. The damage caused by the RCE-RATERO's explosion is similar to a Nitro Cell.
  - The RCE-RATERO will not affect Mira's Black Mirror.
- The explosion has a radius of 3 meters.
- In addition to destroying enemy gadgets, it will also destroy friendly gadgets.
- If the drone latches onto an unreinforced wall, it will create an Impact Grenade sized hole once it has detonated.
- The drone's explosion can immediately break open unreinforced hatches.
- The RCE-RATERO is vulnerable to any source of damage before going into its bulletproof armor state.
- Once in its bulletproof armor state, the only thing that can destroy the RCE-RATERO any source of explosive damage.
- The RCE-RATERO drone will be able to safely destroy anti-projectile gadgets, such as JÃ¤ger's ADSs and Wamai's Mag-NETS since they cannot intercept the drones.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The RCE-RATERO can be used to remotely destroy gadgets which disrupt Attackers such as Maestro's Evil Eyes or Melusi's Banshees.
- The RCE-RATERO can destroy unreinforced walls and hatches, giving allies another option for breaching entrances.
- The RCE-RATERO can destroy Bandit's Shock Wires and Kaid's Electroclaws and prevent "Bandit Tricking" at the same time, opening opportunities for Thermite, Hibana, and Ace to breach reinforced surfaces.

### Counters

- Mute's Signal Jammers can prevent the RCE-RATERO from working if it is caught in their radius, which will also prevent the drone from entering its bulletproof armor state.
  - If the Signal Jammer is destroyed, the RCE-RATERO will not resume its timer. Instead, it will immediately enter its bulletproof state and soon explode.
- While the RCE-RATERO is moving and its fuse has not been activated, it can be destroyed by gunfire. It can also be destroyed by touching objects electrified by Bandit's Shock Wires and Kaid's Electroclaws, and devices with lasers such as Maestro's Evil Eyes and Aruni's Surya Gates.
- Nitro Cells and Impact Grenades can destroy the RCE-RATERO, even if it is in its bulletproof armor.
- Mozzie's Pests can hack the RCE-RATERO while it is still moving. Unlike regular drones, it will only harmlessly destroy it rather than letting Mozzie control it, because the detonation sequence is still active.
- If Mozzie gets his hand on Twitch's Shock Drone he would be able to shot RCE-RATERO before it enters armored state.
- Vigil's ERC will render himself invisible to the RCE-RATERO.
