# Vigil

## Gameplay Description

Vigil comes equipped with his ERC-7 Video Disruptor, which will erase him from video feeds for a set amount of time.

- The ERC-7 works on a charge system; it has infinite uses but limited duration and charge. It can be manually deactivated while active.
  - The ERC-7 has a maximum duration of 12 seconds.
  - The ERC-7 recharges when it is deactivated. The recharge rate is twice as fast as the depletion rate, with a maximum recharge time of 6 seconds.
  - The ability icon for the ERC-7's cloak will turn red to show the player that the ERC-7 has only 4 seconds of use left.
  - Vigil can activate his ERC-7 as long as it has at least 25% charge.
- When the ERC-7 is active, Vigil gains the following effects:
  - Vigil becomes invisible to all Attacker camera feeds, including Drones and Surveillance Cameras hijacked by Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb. This also includes:
    - Bulletproof Cameras, when hacked by Dokkaebi
    - Attacker drones hacked by Mozzie's Pests, when hacked by Dokkaebi
    - Twitch's Shock Drones
    - Valkyrie's Black Eye cameras, when hacked by Dokkaebi
    - Echo's Yokai Drones, when hacked by Dokkaebi
    - Maestro's Evil Eyes, when hacked by Dokkaebi
    - Iana's Gemini Replicator
    - Zero's Argus Cameras
    - Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones
  - The Video Disruptor has an unlimited effective range, but takes a second before making Vigil fully invisible to cameras and drones.
    - Within 12 meters of Vigil's active ERC-7 a drone or camera will begin to see the interference border.
  - Any camera feed that is under the effects of the ERC-7 will have a unique interference border around the edge of the screen when Vigil is within range.
    - The interference border gets bigger the closer Vigil is.
  - Affected surveillance tools will emit a white light.
  - Due to only editing the visual camera feed, Vigil can still be heard by drones or cameras.
  - The ERC-7 will not have any effect with friendly gadgets, until they are hacked by Dokkaebi. Defenders will be able to see Vigil on their point of view within cameras, but Attackers will not.

### Counters

- Thatcher's EMP Grenades can disable Vigil's ERC-7 for 15 seconds.
- IQ will be able to detect the ERC-7 whenever Vigil activates the ability. Specifically, IQ will detect the ERC-7 pack itself.
- Gridlock's Trax Stingers can impede Vigil's strong roaming capabilities.
- Jackal is still able to detect Vigil's footprints, as the ERC-7 only protects him from visual electronic monitoring.
