# Clash

## Gameplay Description

Clash comes equipped with a special Crowd Control Electro Shield. When in use, it fully extends to cover her front-side. The Shield also has a taser function that can damage and slow down enemies in front of her, preventing incoming rushes from Attackers.

- When accessing her gadget, Clash takes her shield off her back to deploy her see-through shield. While the shield is out, she has no access to her sidearms or any of her other items.
  - The shield can be accessed either through the gadget button or primary weapon button.
  - Attempting to go onto cameras will cause her to put her shield away.
  - It takes 3 seconds to switch from the shield to her sidearm.
    - However, when Clash's shield is hit it's quicker to switch to her sidearm.
  - When crouched her shield will block all damage except for the slight top of her head.
- Much like Montagne, Clash's shield extends to cover her whole body from the front. This is the shield's default state when deployed, and cannot be carried like a normal Ballistic Shield.
  - Compared to Montagne, Clash will have one foot set a bit back, exposing her to damage if not in a corner.
  - Clash will absorb 66% of damage dealt from any source of explosive damage. This applies to all operators standing behind the shield.
- The Shield is able to deny Attackers from entering windows. For rappelling Attackers, they are rappelled in the same way when they do not detonate a Breach Charge when entering through a window. This is also true even for Amaru, as Clash's shield will be able to deny Amaru's Garra Hook from entering.
- While unable to properly melee strike with her shield, the tasers on it can shock enemies in a cone in front of her, damaging them and slowing them briefly.
- Clash will affect multiple Operators if they are within a meter or less of a targeted individual. This also includes if they are behind another Operator.
  - The taser has a total run duration of five seconds, while it recharges 20% per second, fully recharging at the same amount.
    - Even if Clash stops using her shield the recharge will still run.
    - The taser's range is roughly 12 meters in all directions.
    - The taser's area of effect is not effective vertically, being better suited to fight Operators at the same level of height.
    - The recharge has a half-second delay.
    - If the taser's battery is fully depleted, Clash needs to wait for the battery to fully recharge before reuse.
    - Clash's CCE Shield's taser has no effect whatsoever on any gadgets.
  - The electricity damages the enemy once per second, dealing 5 damage per second.
  - The Speed Reduction effect starts off minor and short. However, the longer an Attacker is exposed to the taser, the stronger and longer the slow is, up to 1.5 seconds. Attackers cannot run during this duration.
    - While not being tasered, the slowing effect slowly dwindles over a short period of time.
    - The Speed Reduction is considered an effect, similar to Lesion's Gu Mines. As such, there is an indicator of how long the effect will last until it runs out.
- When not deployed, the shield is placed on her back, as is the case with all other Shield Operators.
  - The CCE Shield can also bounce Stun Grenades, Grenades, and Smoke Grenades off her shield.
  - Twitch's Shock Drone darts don't have an effect on the CCE Shield's taser functions.
  - If somehow Oryx runs into Clash's CCE Shield when using his Remah Dash, no effect will occur.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Clash can block drone holes with a shield on her back.

### Counters

- Clash's Shield can be knocked back with a melee strike, leaving the lower half of her body exposed for a brief moment.
  - Similar to other shield operators, Concussion effects from Zofia's or Ela's gadgets will make Clash vulnerable as if her shield has been struck by a melee.
  - Kali's CSRX 300 is powerful enough to knock Clash's shield aside also leaving her vulnerable.
- When she has her shield out, Clash is quite vulnerable to Capit√£o's Asphyxiating Bolts, as her slow mobility makes it hard to escape the fire compared to her fellow Defenders.
- While the CCE Shield's taser is active, IQ can detect it with her scanner.
- Nomad's Airjabs can easily knock Clash on the ground leaving her vulnerable to attackers.
- Gridlock's Trax Stingers can force her to move back to avoid taking damage, as she cannot shoot while the CCE Shield is deployed.
- Thatcher's EMP Grenades will disable the taser function on the CCE for a duration of 15 seconds.
- Impact EMP Grenades will disable the taser function on the CCE for 9 seconds
- Flores' RCE-RATERO drone can deal high damage when close enough to Clash, despite the explosion damage reduction.
