# Mute

## Gameplay Description

Mute is equipped with four GC90 "Moni" Signal Disruptors, jamming communications for remotely detonated gadgets such as Breach Charges or Drones.

- Mute's Signal Disruptors are portable devices that can be placed on the floor to jam Attacker's electronic devices in a wide area.
  - Signal Disruptors have a rather long deployment time of 3 seconds. Gadget deployment method is similar to Bandit's Shock Wires.
  - A placed Signal Disruptor makes an audible buzzing noise.
  - Mute can see the effective range of the Signal Disruptors by a red circle that appears around the jammers when deploying them.
  - Defenders see a special icon on the HUD when they are inside the effective range of Signal Disruptors.
  - Signal Disruptors have a spherical area of effect, with a radius of 2.25 meters. This effectively covers two Reinforced Walls, and can jam some trapdoors from below.
  - The Signal Disruptor is an electronic gadget, and can thus be:
    - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
    - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
    - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
    - Destroyed by lasers fired by Twitch's Shock Drones
- Gadgets under effect of a Signal Disrupter will display a visual feedback.
- Drones within the Disruptors' effective range cannot move, cannot turn, cannot scan, and their cameras are blacked out with static.
  - Twitch's Shock Drones are also affected inside the Disruptor's effective range, and they cannot fire their laser when jammed.
  - Flores' RCE-RATERO stops working if it is caught inside the Disruptor's radius, which will also prevent the drone from entering its bulletproof armor state.
    - If the Signal Jammer is destroyed, the RCE-RATERO will not resume its timer. Instead, it will immediately enter its bulletproof state and soon explode.
- Claymores placed within the Disruptors' effective range are disabled and cannot be triggered.
- The following remotely detonated attacker gadgets cannot be activated if they are placed within the effective range of a Signal Disruptor:
  - Breach Charges
  - Hard Breach Charge
  - Thermite's Exothermic Charges
  - Fuze's Cluster Charges
  - Hibana's X-KAIROS pellets
- The following attacker gadgets cannot be activated if the Attacker activating them is standing within the effective range of a Signal Disruptor:
  - Remotely detonated gadgets (see above).
  - Blitz's Flash Shield
  - Jackal's Eyenox; it can still be toggled, and can still see footprints, but Jackal cannot activate its scanning capabilities.
    - Jackal's vision when the Eyenox is flipped down is affected by a disrupting static effect as he moves closer to the Disruptor.
  - Finka's Adrenal Surge
  - Lion's EE-ONE-D
- Lion's EE-ONE-D cannot detect anyone standing next to a Signal Disruptor.
- Ace's SELMA's will not activate when inside the effective range of a Signal Disruptor.
- Nomad's Airjabs placed within the Disruptors' effective range are disabled and cannot be triggered.
- Defenders within the proximity of a Signal Disruptor are immune to the phone buzz hack from Dokkaebi's Logic Bomb. If a Defender's phone is already buzzing, the buzzing will automatically cease if they move into the range of a Signal Disruptor.
- Grim's Kawan Hive doesn't effect Defenders inside of a range of Mute's Signal Disruptor, similar to Dokkaebi's Logic Bimb if Defenders already pinged by Grim they can enter jammers are of effect to remove the pings.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The Signal Disruptors are essential both in the Preparation Phase and in the Active Phase. During the Prep Phase, the Signal Disruptors can be great contributors in preventing Drones from finding the objective. During the Active Phase, the Signal Disruptors can prevent Attacking Operators from using their gadgets or other electronics.
  - Mute can choose where he wishes to place his Disruptors when it comes to doorways: on the outside or the inside. If placed outside, it will prevent Drones from hopping into the room, at the cost of exposing the Disruptor's location. If placed inside, the Disruptors will still jam Drones, but may not prevent them from getting a peek at the objective.
- Like any other gadget, if placed too close to an unreinforced wall, reinforcing that wall will crush the gadget, hence destroying it. The Disruptors will still do their job even if slightly placed away from desired walls.
- Together with Castle, Mute can prevent Attackers from breaching through windows swiftly or a Fuze from deploying his Cluster Charges.
- With Maestro, Mute can jam the reinforced walls and allow Maestro to cover the outside wall.
- Drones that have been jammed by Mute can be Hacked by Mozzie's Pests.

### Counters

- Purely mechanical gadgets are not affected by the Signal Disruptors.
- As an electronic gadget, the Signal Disruptors are susceptible to the same weaknesses as other gadgets of its type.
  - IQ can search and destroy Signal Disruptor from a safe distance with her Electronics Detector.
  - Thatcher is able to disable the Disruptors with his EMP Grenades for a duration of 15 seconds.
  - Impact EMP Grenades disable the Disruptors for 9 seconds.
  - Twitch can be effective in countering the Signal Disruptors. As long as her Shock Drones do not come into jamming range of the Disruptors, Twitch can destroy the Signal Disruptors from a distance.
- Ash's Breaching Rounds are not affected by Signal Disruptors, as they detonate automatically.
- Maverick's blowtorch is not affected by the Signal Disruptor, as it does not use an electronic signal.
- Kali's LV Lances will bypass the Signal Disruptor and destroy them along with any other possible gadgets.
- Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy Signal Disruptors.
- Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones can destroy Signal Disruptors if not disabled before detonating.
