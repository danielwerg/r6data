# Sens

## Gameplay Description

Sens' Unique Gadget is the ROU Projector, a wheel-like device which deposits small projectors on the ground. When thrown or sent rolling, the ROU drops a line of electronic hologram projectors behind it, which activate to create a wall of light. This light wall completely obscures anything behind it, making it ideal for providing visual cover for Attackers by cutting off the Defender's line of sight.

- R.O.U. takes 5 seconds to fully deploy making a projection wall of roughly 13 meters made of 10 sections
- Each section of a projection wall lasts for 13 seconds
- Could be slowed down by barbed wire which will decrees total length of a wall
- While rolling, the R.O.U. can ricochet off walls and travel in a different direction unlike Ying's Candelas.
- The projectors can be compared to the standard Smoke Grenade secondary gadget:
  - Normal smoke grenades take 3 seconds before activating, whereas ROU projectors create the wall instantly. This might be beneficial for some strategies.
  - Normal smoke grenades last for 12 seconds, while the projectors each last 15 seconds. This means that the projectors last 25% longer than normal smoke grenades do.
    - The projectors beep when the wall is about to expire.
  - Sens gets 4 uses of the gadget, whereas other Operators only get 2 Smoke Grenades.
