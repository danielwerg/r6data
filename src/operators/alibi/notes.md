# Alibi

## Gameplay Description

Alibi carries three Prismas, special devices that project volumetric displays of herself. If an enemy were to interfere with the program, they will activate a tracking feature that will cause the victim to be detected for a short while.

- Alibi's Prismas are activated when thrown on the floor with enough space around. Once activated, the Prisma will take one second to create a volumetric display.
  - If there's not enough space, the Prisma will attempt to deploy and then enter a "jammed" state where they shine with a blinking red light and refuse to deploy.
  - If the Prisma is placed in a doorway and a barricade is later placed onto said doorway, the Prisma will destroy itself.
  - Mute's Signal Jammers have no effect on Prismas.
  - The Prisma is an electronic gadget.
- Volumetric displays always show an Alibi in her default uniform, equipped with an unmodified Mx4 Storm SMG in standing position.
  - The volumetric display faces the same direction as the thrower when the Prisma was thrown down.
  - In terms of model and animation, the volumetric displays' model of Alibi differ from the real Alibi in the following ways:
    - The volumetric displays are completely still.
    - The displays have their eyes hidden by their goggles, where the real Alibi's eyes aren't.
    - The displays, in general, are of a slightly darker shade than the real Alibi and are noticeably lower in quality when observed from up close.
  - Drones will not detect or ping volumetric displays when scanning.
  - Outlines of the volumetric displays are shown through walls for all Defenders.
  - Volumetric displays are identified with special symbols hovering above them for Defenders.
  - The volumetric display will flash blue when interacted by an Operator or Drone, or when bullets fly through it.
  - If Alibi or anyone stands over an active Prisma, the display will disappear as long as they stand on it.
- The Prisma's tracking feature will activate when an Attacker interacts with the projection in any way. This includes:
  - Shooting at the projection
  - Driving their drones through the projection
  - Moving through the projection
  - Throwing a grenade through the projection
  - Firing a projectile through the projection (e.g. Hibana firing an X-KAIROS pellet through the projection)
  - Meleeing the projection
- The tracking lasts for five seconds, creating a static 3D ping of the tracked Attacker's position that refreshes once every second, creating 5 pings in total.
  - Attackers will not be tracked during the Preparation Phase, even if their Drone interacts with a Prisma.
- The identities of all Defenders are completely hidden when a Defender is identified either by being outside or when tracked by Lion's EE-ONE-D.
  <!-- - When activated outside the building, a Prisma's projection will also become identified with the concealed identity. -->

### Strategies/Synergies

- Prismas best positioned on common angles Defenders will be holding.

### Counters

- Prismas can be destroyed by an Attacker without triggering the tracking effect, as long as the Attacker hits the Prisma and not the display.
- As an electronic gadget, the Prismas are susceptible to the same weaknesses as other gadgets of its type.
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades can disable the Prismas for a duration of 15 seconds.
  - Impact EMP Grenades can disable Prismas for 9 seconds.
  - Twitch's Shock Drones can destroy the Prismas with ease with a simple hit of their Laser.
  - IQ's Electronics Detector can detect the Prismas, but will only outline the device itself, not the display. The real Alibi can stand on top of a Prisma, and the Detector wouldn't be able to discern the difference.
  - Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy Prismas if given an angle on the gadget.
  - Kali's LV Lances can destroy the Prisma displays.
  - The latter applies to Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones.
- Glaz can easily counter Alibi as his Thermal Scope doesn't detect the volumetric displays since they have no thermal reading.
- Jackal's Eyenox can discern the footprints of Defenders, bypassing Alibi's ability to hide the identities of herself and her allies.
- Nøkk will not trigger the tracking if she decides to shoot at the volumetric displays or move through the volumetric displays when her gadget is active.
