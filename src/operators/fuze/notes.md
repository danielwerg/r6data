# Fuze

## Gameplay Description

Fuze carries four APM-6 "Matryoshka" Cluster Charges capable of clearing rooms by deploying five sub-grenades through destructible structures such as walls, floors, and windows.

- The Cluster Charge can be deployed on any destructible or reinforced surface. When activated, it launches five sub-grenades into a room. When deployed on a reinforced surface, the Cluster Charge will take additional 2 seconds to activate.
  - Only one Cluster Charge can be deployed at a time. Attempting to set more down will only result in the original Cluster Charge being detonated.
  - Fuze takes 2 seconds to deploy a Cluster Charge.
  - During the deployment time Fuze can be killed and the Cluster Charge will be immediately removed upon death.
  - The Cluster Charge can be destroyed by any source of damage after being deployed (e.g. explosive damage, gunfire, melee strikes, etc).
    - This includes any electrical damage such as Bandit's Shock Wires and Kaid's Electroclaw.
    - The Cluster Charge can be destroyed if the surface it is deployed on is destroyed.
  - When a Cluster Charge is activated, it punches a hole with a tube on the surface it is deployed on, at its deployed location.
    - Cluster Charge's tube which comes out in other side of the surface can be shot, if surface is reinforced 1 charge will always get through before Defenders will be able to shot the tube.
  - Fuze cannot activate the Cluster Charge when in a DBNO state.
  - The Cluster Charge is remotely activated, so they cannot be activated if either the charge or Fuze himself are in the effect range of Mute's Signal Disruptors.
- A Cluster Charge's sub-grenades are launched in a line in front of the charge, going from right to left, before detonating in the order they were launched in.
  - Each of the sub-grenades has an explosion radius of 4.2 meters. The explosion deals lethal damage to Medium and Heavy Health Operators at up to 1.2 meters, and lethal damage to Light Health Operators at up to 2 meters.
  - The physics of individual pellets use a precomputed trajectory.
  - The sub-grenades can be intercepted by Jäger's Active Defense System and Wamai's Mag-NETs. However, with ADSs having a recharge timer and Mag-NETs being single-use, Cluster Charges can easily overwhelm these gadgets.
  - When outfitted with his Ballistic Shield, Fuze will absorb 66% of damage dealt from any source of explosive damage. This applies to all operators standing behind the shield.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Cluster Charges can be used to make holes on Castle's Armored Panels, as they punch a hole on activation similar to reinforced walls, allowing Attackers to see through the otherwise bulletproof Armor Panels.
- Due to his gadget being an electronic, Fuze works well with Attackers who help remove Mute's Signal Disruptors and Jäger's Active Defense Systems, which would be IQ, Twitch, Thatcher, Zero, and Flores.
- Cluster Charges could be deployed on Mira's Black Mirror.

### Counters

- Being a deployable gadget, the Cluster Charge is still susceptible to gunfire. Shooting an active Cluster Charge will destroy it, preventing any more sub-grenades from being deployed.
- As the Cluster Charge is a remote-controlled device, Mute's Signal Disruptors can disrupt it if either Fuze or the Cluster Charge are too close to their area of effect.
- Jäger's Active Defense Systems can intercept up to one sub-grenade per Cluster Charge. Fuze carries a total of four cluster charges with each holding five.
- Wamai's Mag-NET, like the Active Defense Systems, can also intercept the Cluster Charges, but only up to four. However, because of how they work, they will only redirect each sub grenade rather than destroy them.
