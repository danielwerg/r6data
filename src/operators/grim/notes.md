# Grim

## Gameplay Description

Grim's Unique Gadget is the Kawan Hive Launcher. It fires canisters which attach to any surface, and release a swarm of nano-bots. Any Defender which enters a swarm will not only be pinged, but the swarm will follow the affected Defender for a period, allowing Grim to track them in real time.

- The launcher features 5 rounds and no reload between shots.
- The Kawan Hive Launcher has equip time of 1 second, fire rate of 70 rpm and cooldown of roughly 1 second.
- Once Hive Canister lands on surface it takes 0.4s to release the bees.
- The Kawan Hive lasts 16 seconds before dissipating.
- The Kawan Hive have a radius of 4.6 meters.
- Hive Canisters are vulnerable to bullets, lasers, melee and explosives.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Grim works well with Jackal and Lion, as their tracking gadgets working in tandem can effectively detect any roaming Defenders.
- Grim's Kawan Hive could be a good help for planting defuser.

### Counters

- Mute's Signal Jammers not only prevent Hive Canisters from deploying their Swarms, they also prevent any Defender within their radius from being detected by the swarm. Defenders who are being tracked by a Swarm can also enter a Signal Jammer's radius to remove the Swarm.
- Surfaces electrified by Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws will destroy any Hive Canisters that touch them.
- Hive Canisters can be caught and destroyed by JÃ¤ger's ADS, Wamai's MAG-NET or Aruni's Surya Gates.
- Vigil won't be pinged when he leaves the swarm if his ERC-7 is on. However, he still will be pinged when he is inside the swarm regardless of if his cloaking is on.
- Impact Grenades are a quick and efficient way to get rid of deployed Hives before they activate.
- Electrified barbed wire can destroy both Grim's Kawan Hive ball and canister.
