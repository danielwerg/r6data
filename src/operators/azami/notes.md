# Azami

## Gameplay Description

Azami's Unique Gadget is the Kiba Barrier, a set of kunai-style throwing knives which transform into barriers with a total of 999 health. When thrown onto a surface, the knives release a foam which expands and hardens into a barrier. As well as creating defensive cover for Defenders, Kiba Barriers can also block off entrances and breach holes, taking away advantages for the Attackers.

- Azami starts with 1 Kiba Barrier and recharges one Barrier per 30 seconds until she reaches total of 5 Barriers.
- Kiba Barrier takes roughly 1 second to fully deploy once it's lands on a surface.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Kiba Barriers can be used alongside Mira's Black Mirrors on an unreinforced wall to protect the user's body while he's surveilling the area.

### Counters

- Kiba Barriers can be damaged by gunfire. The damage dealt to the barriers depends on the weapons' caliber or destruction output.
- Kiba Barriers can also be destroyed by melee attacks: 3 direct hits will break one barrier. Sledge's Breaching Hammer will break it in one hit.
- Kiba Barriers can be destroyed by any explosive device, such as Ash's Breaching Rounds, Kali's LV Lances, Flores's RCE-RATERO Drone, and Zofia's Impact Grenades.
