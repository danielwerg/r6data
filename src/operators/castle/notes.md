# Castle

## Gameplay Description

Castle is equipped with four Universal Tactical Panels (Armor Panels). These special barricades can be deployed on any door or window frame.

- Castle can deploy Armor Panels in place of a normal wooden barricade for doorways and windows. The Armor Panels are bulletproof.
  - Like normal Barricades, Armor Panels are destroyed by explosive damage, as well as Sledge's Breaching Hammer (which behaves as if it deals explosive damage).
  - The flames from Maverick's Breaching Torch can burn holes through an Armor Panel, and eventually destroy the Armor Panel with enough damage.
  - An Armor Panel will always be destroyed if it was hit with 9 melee attacks.
  - Melee attacks and bullet strikes do not create see-through holes on the Armor Panels. <!--(except from the BOSG.12.2)-->
    - Melee attacks will punch a hole on one of the outer layers of the armor panel, but they cannot go through the central layer.
- Like Reinforcements, shooting the actual Panel whilst it's being deployed will still block the bullets.
- Like normal Barricades, Armor Panels placed on doorways are not fully enclosed at the bottom.
- Armor Panels take increased time for Defenders to pull off.
  - Any Armor Panel taken down by Defenders restores another one for Castle.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Because the Armor Panels are always destroyed after 9 melee strikes, the Armor Panels can be used to set up an ambush. By pre-hitting the Armor Panels 8 times, an Operator can then destroy it with one melee attack, giving a surprise to enemies behind it.
  - If a Defender has any Impact Grenades on them, they can use them to instantly destroy his Armor Panels as well for the same tactic.

### Counters

- Armor Panels are bullet-proof, not explosive-proof. Breach Charges and Frag Grenades can take down these barricades with ease.
  - Sledge's Breaching Hammer, Ash's Breaching Rounds and Zofia's Impact Grenades from her Lifeline can also destroy them instantly.
- Some weapons and gadgets can penetrate the Armor Panels:
  - Fuze's Cluster Charges can be deployed on Armor Panels similarly to reinforced walls and will punch out a sizable hole on the Armor Panel after being detonated.
  - Like Fuze, Ying's Candelas can also be deployed on Armor Panels, but the hole created is much smaller.
  <!-- - The 707th SMB's BOSG.12.2 can shoot out one layer out of the three layers that make up an Armor Panel. They can create a peek hole by shooting out all three layers. With 3 holes made (9 layers in total), they can even completely destroy an Armor Panel. -->
  - Maverick can burn holes through an Armor Panel. With enough damage, the Armor Panel will be completely destroyed.
  - Kali can destroy an Armor Panel with her LV Lance.
  - Ace can break Armor Panels with his SELMAs.
  - Flores can destroy Armor Panels with his RCE-RATERO Drones.
  - Hibana's X-KAIROS pellets can destroy Castle's Armor Panel if necessary.
