# Ela

## Gameplay Description

Ela comes equipped with three Grzmot Mines; concussive mines that disorient any who come within range.

- Ela's Grzmot Mines can be thrown and stuck to any surface, whether if it be walls, ceilings, floors, or even furniture.
  - Although in-game, the "sticky bag" on the Mines puffs up over time, this is only a visual effect; there is no need to wait for it before tossing the Mine onto the desired surface.
  - After sticking to a surface, Grzmot Mines take a second to arm itself, after which it can detonate if it is triggered.
    - While the Grzmot Mine is arming itself a visual radius will appear on screen to show the player how far the mine can be triggered.
- Grzmot Mines are triggered when an enemy enters its proximity (radius 4 meters). The Grzmot Mines instantly explode once triggered, concussing anyone (including teammates) within its blast radius and canceling their current actions (excluding the action of pulling the needle from Lesion's Gu mines).
  - The blast radius on the mines (6 meters) is slightly larger than their proximity radius.
  - For the effect to take place the Grzmot Mine needs sight of the upper torso.
  - The concussion effects are follows:
    - Temporary blindness and screen shake immediately after the explosion.
    - Hearing disrupted.
    - Vision disrupted; the player's view will be tinted green, the peripheral vision is blacked out, the player will see double vision, and the player will also see white floating dots.
    - Inability to sprint.
  - The concussion effect lasts 5 seconds.
  - The trigger for the Grzmot Mines require line of sight in addition to proximity. If an enemy is in proximity but not in line of sight with the mine (e.g. the mine being on one side of a wall while the enemy is on the other side), the mine will not detonate.
  - Being stunned by both Echo's Yokai Drone and the Grzmot Mine will not have coupled up effectiveness, as the newer stun effect will override the older one.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Echo's Yokai Drone will not work at the same time with Ela's Grzmot Mines. However, they can be used in tandem to cause a chain of disorientation upon one enemy or a clump of enemies with proper coordination.

### Counters

- Due to her gadgets being electronic, the Grzmot mines are susceptible to the same disadvantages of other electronic devices.
  - IQ can quickly find Ela's Grzmot Mines thanks to her Electronics Detector. Because her scanner has a larger radius than their proximity, they can be shot at from a safer distance.
  - Thatcher can easily disable one or more Grzmot Mine with his EMP grenades for 15 seconds.
  - Impact EMP Grenades can disable Grzmot Mine for 9 seconds.
  - Twitch can scout and take out the Grzmot Mines from a safe distance, allowing them to be destroyed before anyone can be affected.
  - Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy Grzmot Mines if carefully aimed.
  - Kali's LV Lances and Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones can destroy Grzmot Mines.
  - Brava's Kludge Drone can hack Ela's Grzmot Mines, turning them against the defenders.
- If Finka activates her Adrenal Surge while she or her teammates are affected by the Grzmot, the duration of being concussed by a Grzmot Mine is greatly reduced. This also works when a Grzmot is activated during the duration of the Surge, even if the Surge ends before the effects of the Grzmot does. The rate at which a Surged player recovers from a Grzmot is the same rate at which Ela or Zofia recovers normally.
