# Finka

## Gameplay Description

Finka comes equipped with her specially-designed nanobots. Having them injected into each of her teammates prior to each mission, her Adrenal Surge allows affected allies to gain a permanent boost in health, on top of other small benefits.

- Three times per round, Finka is able to activate "Adrenal Surge" for 10 seconds. Adrenal Surge has a 10 second cooldown once activated, effectively having no cooldown between activation.
  - Finka cannot activate Adrenal Surge when she is within the range of Mute's Signal Disruptors.
  - Teammates within Mute's Signal Disruptors will not receive a boost even if they move out of the effective range.
- Upon activation, Adrenal Surge grants all Attackers the following effects:
  - A 20 health heal.
    - The Adrenal Surge can Overheal Operators beyond their health capacity, granting an additional temporary health buffer beyond a player's normal maximum health.
    - An Operator can only have up to 20 extra health from overheals, even when stacked with heals from Thunderbird's Kóna Stations and Doc's Stim Pistol. Overhealed health decays at a rate of 1 health per second.
  - Concussion effects (from Ela's Grzmot Mines and Zofia's Concussion Grenades) and disorientation effects from Echo's Yokai drone are overridden.
  - Downed Attackers (excluding those downed by Frost's Welcome Mats) are revived with 30 health.
    - The revival process takes the same duration as the revival by Doc's Stim Pistol, which is 2.75 seconds.
    - Attackers being interrogated by Caveira will not be revived.
    - Attackers will not lose any effects of the Adrenal Boost if they enter the DBNO state.
    - Finka can self-revive, by activating her Adrenal Surge when downed.
- While active, Adrenal Surge grants all Attackers the following effects:
  - Aim Down Sights speed is increased by 25%.
  - Reload time for weapons and gadgets is decreased by 15%.
  - Movement speed in Barbed Wire is increased by 40%, effectively reducing the Barbed Wire's slowing effect to ~10%.
  - The effects of gadgets like Stun Grenades and Ying's Candelas are reduced by 50%, letting Attackers recover from these effects twice as fast.
  - Concussion effects received are reduced by 75%. Double vision, shaking, and sound distortion are all reduced by a great amount.
  - Tinnitus from explosions are instantly removed.
  - The Attacker can now be detected by Pulse's Cardiac Sensor from up to 14 meters away (compared to the usual 9 meters).
  - Damage received from Smoke's Remote Gas Grenades are increased by 50%.
  - Performing gamemode interactions, such as planting the Defuser in the Bomb gamemode or picking up the Hostage in the Hostage gamemode, with the Adrenal Boost active won't decrease the time it takes to perform the action.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Because Adrenal Surge is also able to grant an increased resistance to Blinding effects, Ying works well with Finka.
  - While Ying is already immune to her own Candelas, allied Attackers can make use of Adrenal Surge to recover faster from the Blinding effect as well.

### Counters

- The effects of Adrenal Surge are overridden for an Attacker when:
  - The Attacker is hit by an ultrasonic blast from Echo's Yokai.
  - The Attacker is poisoned by Lesion's Gu Mines.
- Smoke's Remote Gas Grenades does 50% more damage while Attackers under effect of Adrenal Surge.
- Pulse's Cardiac Sensor can detect Attackers from up to 14 meters away (compared to the usual 9 meters) under effect of Adrenal Surge.
